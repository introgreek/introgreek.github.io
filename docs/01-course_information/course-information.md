## Course Description

This course is an introduction to the ancient Greek language, the mode of communication that defines the literature and culture of ancient Greece. No previous knowledge of Greek is required. This course will start from the very basics of the Greek language (i.e., alphabet, parts of speech, inflection, pronunciation) and eventually build towards a strong command of Greek vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. The goal of introductory Greek is to build a solid foundation for reading actual ancient Greek texts. As such, the acquisition of those linguistic skills, elucidated and practiced through classroom instruction and examples in our textbook, will also be reinforced by the reading of select prose passages in Greek.

## Course Goals and Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, an introduction to the ancient Latin language, my goal is that as far as **disciplinary content** is concerned, you as students will be able to:
* develop your knowledge base of Greek (and English) morphology and syntax
* develop confidence in engaging with complex sentence structures and narratives
* practice close reading and identifying linguistic patterns
* analyze and engage with unedited Greek
* learn about and appreciate aspects of ancient Greek culture

At a **global level**, this course is designed to improve your abilities in the following [IDEA Learning Objectives](https://www.ideaedu.org/idea-notes-on-learning/):
* gaining a basic understanding of the subject (e.g., factual knowledge, methods, principles, generalizations, theories) (IDEA #1)
* developing knowledge and understanding of diverse perspectives, global awareness, or other cultures (IDEA #2)
* learning to apply course material (to improve thinking, problem solving, and decisions) (IDEA #3)
* learning how to find, evaluate, and use resources to explore a topic in depth (IDEA #9)

As **outcomes of your learning**, you will:
* produce idiomatic English translations of both edited and authentic Greek
* compose short narratives in grammatically-sound Greek based on real ancient myths
* complete daily homework assignments to practice concepts and increase familiarity with vocabulary, paradigms, and sentence structures
* achieve high grades on daily check-ins, weekly quizzes, and tri-semesterly exams by demonstrating your understanding of Greek morphology and syntax and applying grammatical rules
* generate 1-2pp. written responses to articles, videos, events, and physical media like ancient coins that explore Greek grammar and Roman culture in outside-of-the-box ways
