### Part 2
{: .no_toc }

Write out the following words in the Greek alphabet. Make sure to include rough or smooth breathing marks, but other accents (like the acute, grave, or circumflex) are not necessary. Keep in mind that a mark over a vowel (e.g., ē) means that you should consider it the long version of that vowel (i.e., ē = η and ō = ω; without the long mark, e = ε [epsilon] and o = ο [omicron]).

1. eblepsen
2. harpazō
3. edeixanto
4. edeikhthē
5. poiēmata
6. hodōi (treat the last -i as an iota subscript)

10. ēnekhthē

2. πολιτης (persistent accent on penult, long iota, long ultima)
3. πολιται (persistent accent on penult, long iota, short ultima)
4. κελευει (recessive accent)
5. first word in ὁδος στενή (persistent accent on ultima)
6. first word in στενη γε (persistent accent on ultima, γε is enclitic)
