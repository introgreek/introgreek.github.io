## Second Aorist

As discussed in [the unit on first aorists](first-aorist#first-and-second-aorists), a verb's third principal part can be either **first aorist** or **second aorist**, as determined by the principal part's ending: a **first aorist** ends in -α or -άμην, while a **second aorist** ends in -ον or -όμην. Note, for example, the dictionary entries for ἄγω, ἔχω, and λέγω above: their third principal parts each end in -ον, which means that they are **second aorists**.

The distinction between **first aorists** and **second aorists** affects only the formation of the **aorist active and middle**, i.e., the forms created using the **third principal part**. There is no meaningful distinction of first or second aorist in the aorist passive or sixth principal part; the distinction affects only the aorist active and middle. Otherwise, the first and second aorist operate along the same general rules: they indicate an instantaneous or completed event in the past in the active or middle voice.

### Formation

The conjugation of the second aorist is very similar to the conjugation of the first aorist, just with different endings.

Here are the steps to conjugate a second aorist:
1. To get the verb stem, take the -ον off the third principal part.  
2. Add the appropriate ending to indicate the appropriate person, number, and voice.  
3. Apply a recessive accent based on the rules laid out [in the unit on accents](../basics/alphabet-and-accents#accents).

#### (2nd) Aorist Active Endings

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | `-ον` | `-ομεν` |
| 2nd | `-ες` | `-ετε`|
| 3rd | **-ε(ν)** | **-ον** |

#### (2nd) Aorist Middle Endings

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | `-όμην` | `-όμεθα` |
| 2nd | `-ου` | `-εσθε`|
| 3rd | **-ετο** | **-οντο** |

#### Application
{: .no_toc }

Let's practice conjugating the second aorist with the verb ἄγω (third principal part: **ἤγαγον**).

1. When we take off the -ον, we are left with the stem **ἤγαγ-**.
2. We can then apply the appropriate endings:
    * for the active, it's -ε(ν) for the 3rd singular and -ον for the third plural.
    * for the middle, it's -ετο for the 3rd singular and -οντο for the third plural.
3. All accents will be placed on the antepenult since none of the ultimas contained in these endings is long.

These rules result in the following forms:

| Voice | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Active | ἤγαγε(ν) | ἤγαγον |
| Middle | ἠγάγετο | ἠγάγοντο |  

#### Translation
{: .no_toc }

Again, the only difference between a second aorist and a first aorist is the endings used to conjugate it; everything else, including how the verb's aspects affect our translation, remains the same. The verbal action is still an instantaneous or completed action in the past, and the voice of the verb indicates the relationship of the subject to the verb's action. So, here are some examples of ways to translate our newly-conjugated forms:

* ἤγαγεν: "he/she/it led"
* ἤγαγον: "they led"
* ἠγάγετο: "he/she/it led (for themself)"
* ἠγάγοντο: "they led (for themselves)"
