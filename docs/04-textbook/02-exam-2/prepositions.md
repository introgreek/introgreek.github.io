## Prepositional Phrases

A **preposition** is a *bridge word* that either relates one noun to another noun or qualifies the action of the verb. The preposition takes a **prepositional object**, and the whole unit (preposition plus object) is called a **prepositional phrase**.

Here are examples of prepositional phrases that qualify nouns:
* I found the mistake **in the essay**.
* The dog **behind the window** is very cute.

In these examples, the prepositional phrase tells us more about a noun by answering the question "which one"?
* I found the mistake. -- Which mistake? The one **in the essay** (as opposed to a mistake anywhere else).
* The dog is very cute. -- Which dog? The one **behind the window** (as opposed to the one *in the park* or the one *under the blanket*).

Compare this against prepositional phrases that function adverbially, to answer questions like "where", "when" or "how":
* We are standing **on the platform.** (Where are we standing? On the platform.)
* The clock chimes **on the hour.** (When does it chime? On the hour, every hour.)

In all of these examples, the preposition (e.g., "in", "behind", "on") serves as a bridge word that relates the prepositional object either to another noun or to the verb's action.

## Prepositions and Object Cases

In Greek, a preposition usually has some sort of core location or direction inherent in its definition. To take some examples from the [Week 6 Vocabulary](../../vocabulary/week-06-vocabulary):

* οἱ ἄνθρωποι **ἀπὸ τῆς θάλαττης** ἦλθον. The people came **from the sea**.
* ὁ μάρτυς **ἐν τῇ πόλει** ἠδικήθη. The witness was injured **in the city.** (πόλει > dative singular of πόλις, -εως, f. - city)
* οἱ παῖδες **εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν** ἤχθησαν. The children were led **into the house.** (οἰκίαν > accusative singular of οἰκία, -ας, f. - house)

ἀπό embodies the sense that a noun is moving **away from** something; ἐν embodies the sense that a noun is **in** a location; and εἰς embodies the sense that a noun is moving **into** a location. Other prepositions indicate different directions or locations; for example, πρός indicates motion **to or toward** something, while παρά indicates that something is **near or next to** something else.

In Greek, prepositional objects can be in one of the oblique cases (meaning the **genitive**, **dative**, or **accusative**). Some prepositions take only **one** case as an object. For example, note how εἰς in the [Week 6 Vocabulary](../../vocabulary/week-06-vocabulary) is followed by **(+ acc.)**. This means that εἰς tends to be used only with the **accusative** case. Similarly, **ἐν** takes the **dative**, while **ἐκ** and **ἀπό** take the **genitive**.

Other prepositions, however, can take a noun in **any** of the oblique cases as an object. The differences in using one case over another can vary from small semantic differences to entirely discrete translations. Take, for example, μετά in the [Week 6 Vocabulary](../../vocabulary/week-06-vocabulary). When its object is in the accusative case, μετά means "after":

* ὁ πολίτης ἦλθε **μετὰ τὸν δικαστήν**. The citizen came *after the juror*.

However, when the object of μετά is in the *genitive* case, μετά means "with":

* ὁ πολίτης ἦλθε **μετὰ τοῦ δικαστοῦ**. The citizen came *with the juror*.

So, you must both know what the preposition means and pay attention to the case of its object; the case of the object can change that definition, the meaning of the prepositional phrase, and the idea being communicated by the sentence.

### Case Directions

With prepositions that can take any of the three oblique cases, there is often a rationale to the use of one case versus another. We've discussed how each preposition has a location or direction inherent in its definition, but the case of a prepositional object *also* has a direction or location inherent in it:
* The **accusative** usually indicates **motion toward** the prepositional object.
* The **dative** usually indicates a **static location** for the prepositional object.
* The **genitive** usually indicates **motion away from** the prepositional object.

When we combine the case of the prepositional object with the direction/location in the preposition, we can create specific and interesting pictures about how a verbal action works. Note, for example, the difference in the following two sentences:

* ἦλθον **κατὰ τοῦ δένδρου**. (δένδρον, δένδρου, n. - tree)
  * They came down from the tree.
* ἦλθον **κατὰ τὸ δένδρον**.
  * They came down to the tree.

The direction of "down" is inherent in the preposition κατά, and it indicates in what direction the subject is coming (ἦλθον κατά - they came *down*). The object of the preposition, then, fills out the picture further. If we use the genitive, which indicates **motion away from** the object, the image that we get is of the subject climbing down from the tree, presumably from a high branch to the ground below: ἦλθον κατὰ τοῦ δένδρου, they came *down from* (κατά + gen.) the tree. However, if we use the accusative, which indicates **motion toward** the object, the image that we get is of the subject approaching the tree, presumably from higher ground to the tree on a lower level: ἦλθον κατὰ τὸ δένδρον, they came down *to* (κατά + acc.) the tree. These nuances draw a more detailed and complete picture of how a verbal action occurs.

## Genitive of Agent

One special type of prepositional phrase is known as the **genitive of agent**. In this construction, **a prepositional phrase using ὑπό and a genitive noun indicates who performs the action of a** ***passive verb***. Here's an example:

* ὁ μάρτυς **ὑπὸ τῶν πολιτῶν** εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν ἄγεται. The witness is being led into the house **by the citizens**.

Consider why we would need a construction like the genitive of agent. If the verb is **active or middle**, the **nominative subject** performs the verb's action:

* οἱ πολῖται τὸν μάρτυρα ἄγουσιν. The citizens are leading the witness.

In a sentence with a **passive** verb, however, the subject *receives* the action, rather than performing it. In this construction, we don't necessarily *need* an indication of who performs the action for the sentence to be grammatically correct:

* ὁ μάρτυς εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν ἄγεται. The witness is being led into the house.

We're left wondering, though -- who is doing the leading? Who is performing that verb's action? A **genitive of agent** construction helps answer that question, even though it is not technically necessary for the sentence to make sense. So, **ὑπὸ τῶν πολιτῶν** ("by the citizens") gives us that answer.
