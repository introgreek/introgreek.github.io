## Course Description

This course is the first semester of a year-long introduction to the ancient Greek language, the mode of communication that defines the literature and culture of ancient Greece. No familiarity with Greek is required. This course will instruct you in the basics of the Greek language (e.g., declension, conjugation, sentence structure, etc.) and eventually build towards a strong command of Greek vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. The goal of first-year Greek is to build a solid foundation for reading actual ancient Greek texts. As such, the acquisition of those linguistic skills, elucidated and practiced through classroom practice and translation and composition exercises, will set a foundation for reading unedited Greek from Lysias' first oration, a masterpiece of Greek oratory.
