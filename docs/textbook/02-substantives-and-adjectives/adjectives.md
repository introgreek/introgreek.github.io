## Adjectives

**Adjectives** are words that modify substantives. They can describe a noun or pronoun or help disambiguate one noun from another noun. Take a look at the examples below:

* The **tired** teacher woke up at 6am.
* The **quick, brown** fox jumped over the **lazy** dog.
* Fall break was too **short**.
* The students became **happy**.

In each of these sentences, the bolded adjectives modify nouns. The teacher is **tired**. The fox is **quick** and **brown**, and the dog is **lazy**.

This applies in the third and fourth sentences as well. Note that **short** tells us more about fall break, and the adjective modifies fall break even though it occurs on the opposite side of the linking verb "was." Similarly, **happy** modifies "students" even though it occurs on the opposite side of the linking verb "became." The core function of an adjective is to modify a substantive, whether it's placed close to it or on the other side of a linking verb like "to be" or "to become."

## Noun-Adjective Agreement

In Greek, the primary way that we can tell that an adjective modifies a noun is through a principle called **noun-adjective agreement**:

**noun-adjective agreement**: an adjective must match the noun that it modifies in **gender, case, and number**.

This means that, for example, if a noun is in the masculine nominative plural, any adjective that modifies it must be in the masculine nominative plural as well. If the noun is feminine dative singular, then any adjective that modifies it must be feminine dative singular.

## Adjective Declension

If an adjective must match a noun in gender, case, and number, it stands to reason that the adjective itself can be declined into any gender, case, and number. This concept is familiar to us from the [definite article](nom-gen-art#the-definite-article-ὁ-ἡ-τό) (which itself is basically an adjective!).

Like the definite article, adjectives can decline into any of the combinations of aspects that we've discussed so far:
* gender: masculine, feminine, neuter
* number: singular, plural, [dual]
* case: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, [vocative]

Like nouns, however, adjectives belong to certain groups and subgroups that determine what sets of endings can indicate gender, case, and number.
