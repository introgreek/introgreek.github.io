## Substantive Modifiers

Greek uses many kinds of modifiers or descriptors to tell us more about substantives, and we've already learned three major methods of modification:
* using an **adjective** ("the **noble** citizen", ὁ **ἀγαθὸς** πολίτης)
* using a **prepositional phrase** ("the people **near the sea**", οἱ **παρὰ τῇ θαλάττῃ** ἄνθρωποι)
* using a **genitive noun** (to describe who possesses another noun) ("the child **of the man**", ἡ **τοῦ ἀνδρὸς** παῖς)

To these three, we can add a rather unintuitive fourth: we can use **adverbs** to modify nouns. **Adverbs** normally modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. For example, note some examples using adverbs from the [Unit Vocabulary](#unit-vocabulary) above:

* ὁ παῖς τὰ ἔργα **νῦν** ποιεῖ. The child is doing the deeds **now**.
* ἡ γυνὴ **τότε** ἔγραφεν. The woman was writing **at that time**.
* τὸ βιβλίον **οὐ** μίκρον. The book is **not** small. (We'll discuss "is" later on in this unit.)

In these examples, the bolded adverbs modify verbs like ποιεῖ and ἔγραφεν and adjectives like μίκρον. However, Greek adverbs can also serve as modifiers for substantives like nouns. Note the following:

* οἱ τότε ἄνθρωποι, "the people **at that time**"
* οἱ νῦν ἄνθρωποι, "the people **now**", "the people **today**"

The clue as to whether an adverb is functioning regularly (i.e., modifying a verb, adjective, or other adverb) versus modifying a substantive lies in **its position in relation to the noun and its article**: that is, whether the adverb is in the **attributive** or **predicative** position.

***

## Attributive and Predicative Position

When they modify nouns, all four methods (adjectives, prepositional phrases, genitive nouns, or adverbs) can exist in one of two positions in relationship to the noun and article: **attributive** or **predicative** position. Each position indicates a different relationship between the modifier and the noun: a modifier in the **attributive** position simply describes the noun, while a modifier in the **predicative** position can form an entire sentence without an explicit verb.

### Attributive Position

There are three primary versions of attributive position:
1. article - modifier - noun
2. article - noun - article - modifier
3. noun - article - modifier (this version is rare)

Thus, take a look at the following example that includes a modifier with the article and noun in the first two attributive position configurations, which are far more common than the third:

* ὁ ἀνὴρ λέγει **τὸν πρῶτον λόγον.**
* ὁ ἀνὴρ λέγει **τὸν λόγον τὸν πρῶτον.**

The noun phrase in each example is functionally the same. The modifier πρῶτον describes the noun λόγον, and the article τὸν links them together. In the two most common configurations of attributive position, the article and the noun are the bread that form a modifier sandwich, or the article is repeated with the modifier following the repeated article. This is where we must be able to tell what noun belongs with which article; remember that the article, like an adjective, must match its noun in gender, case, and number.

This idea becomes particularly important when modifiers consist of more than one word, e.g. prepositional phrases or genitive nouns. Note the following examples.

* ἡ οἰκία ἡ ἐπὶ τῇ ὁδῷ ὑπὸ τῶν ὑστάτων πολιτῶν ἐποιήθη. The house on the road was made by the last citizens.

Here, we have *two* examples of modification, both in the attributive position: ἡ οἰκία ἡ ἐπὶ τῇ ὁδῷ and τῶν ὑστάτων πολιτῶν. While the modifier in the latter phrase consists of one word (ὑστάτων), the modifier in the former phrase consists of three: ἐπὶ τῇ ὁδῷ. This is where we must use the context of the whole phrase or sentence to understand what belongs where and what modifies what. Note that ἡ οἰκία is immediately followed by a repetition of the article ἡ. This repetition leads us to expect some kind of modifier, which can be any of the four methods discussed above (adjective, prepositional phrase, genitive noun, or adverb). Since we immediately get the preposition ἐπί next, then we need to search for its object, which is τῇ ὁδῷ. Thus, the entire phrase belongs together: ἡ οἰκία ἡ ἐπὶ τῇ ὁδῷ.

* οἱ σώφρονες ἄγουσιν τὸν παῖδα τὸν τοῦ ἀνδρός. The wise people lead the child of the man.

In this example, note the accusative noun phrase and the juxtaposition of articles in the middle: τὸν παῖδα τὸν τοῦ ἀνδρός. As in the last example, the repeated article τὸν leads us to expect a modifier of some sort. Here, the modifier is a genitive phrase that indicates whose child it is ("the man's", τοῦ ἀνδρός). τοῦ ἀνδρός forms a single unit that gets attached in the attributive position to the noun that it describes, τὸν παῖδα.

### Predicative Position

If a modifier occurs outside of the three configurations listed above, then it is in **predicative position**. While it can serve the same purpose as a modifier in the attributive position (i.e., simply describing a substantive), more often, it actually helps create a full sentence without the use of a conjugated verb. The **predicate** of a sentence is the section of the sentence that contains the verb and non-subject words associated with the verb (e.g., direct objects, predicate nominatives [on which see below], adverbs). So, it stands to reason that a modifier in the **predicative position** can create a predicate.

The verb that a modifier in the predicative position supplies is the linking verb "to be." So, note the following example:

* δίκαιοι οἱ δικασταί. The jurors are just.

In this example, there is no explicit conjugated verb, but because the adjective δίκαιοι is in the predicative position, we can *supply* a form of the verb "to be."

Note that this also constitutes the second use of the **nominative case** that we'll learn about this semester: the **predicate nominative** is an adjective or noun in the nominative case that

## The Verb εἰμί

As mentioned above, the verb "to be" is not strictly needed to form a complete Greek sentence, since using the predicative position does the work of the linking verb for you. The verb can be made explicit, though, by using forms of the verb εἰμί, an irregular verb. This means that its forms change stems and endings in unpredictable ways, and thus their paradigms must be memorized.
