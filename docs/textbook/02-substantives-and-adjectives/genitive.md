### Genitive
{: .no_toc }
There are quite a few **uses** of the genitive, but we'll focus on only one for now:
* **possession**. The genitive case is used to indicate who possesses or owns another noun. Often, the genitive in this instance can be translated with the preposition "of" (e.g., "the home **of the man**") or with an apostrophe, as in English possession. Note the following Greek to English renderings:
  * ἡ γνώμη **τοῦ ἀνδρός**, "The opinion **of the man**"
  * τὰ ἔργα **τῆς γυναικός**, "The deeds **of the woman**"

Note that we can also write the phrases above in the following way, sandwiching the genitive phrase between the article and the noun without any change in meaning:

* ἡ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς γνώμη, "the opinion of the man"
* τὰ τῆς γυναικὸς ἔργα, "the deeds of the woman"

This places the genitive phrase in what is called the *attributive position*, which we'll learn about more below. But first, we need to learn about the **definite article**.
