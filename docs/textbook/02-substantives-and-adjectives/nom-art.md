## Case Uses: Nominative

As indicated [in the nouns overview](nouns-overview), the **case** of a noun indicates its function within a sentence, and the case is indicated by the ending on the noun. The function of the specific case is called a **use**, so we can speak about, e.g., the "uses" of the nominative or the "uses" of the accusative.

The noun's dictionary entry gives you two forms of the noun (nominative singular and genitive singular), so let's explore what each case can do over the next two units. First up: the nominative.

### Nominative
{: .no_toc }
The **nominative** is named after the Latin noun *nomen*, or "name." Thus, the nominative is the "naming" case of a noun and gives us the first part of the dictionary entry, which we use to alphabetize our dictionaries.

There are only two **uses** of the nominative:
* **subject**. The nominative case of the noun can make it function as the *subject* of a verb, either the actor of an active verb (e.g., "**The army** *marches* to the sea") or the receiver of the action of a middle/passive verb (e.g., "**The army** *is seen* by the citizens").
* **predicate nominative**. The simplest type of sentence uses a *linking verb* (like the verb "to be") to equate two things. For example, "The word is the gift." In this sentence, the linking verb "is" connects "the gift" back to the subject "the word" and indicates that they refer to the same thing. While "the word" is the subject (and thus would be in the nominative case), "the gift" serves as a **predicate nominative**, a word or phrase in the *predicate* of the sentence (e.g., the part of the sentence that follows the verb in English) that gets linked back to the subject.
  * We'll learn more about the verb "to be" at the end of this unit. It is actually technically not necessary to form a full Greek sentence, since it can be left out but understood by context. So, the sentence "The word is the gift" can be rendered as follows: ὁ λόγος τὸ δῶρον. (More on "the" next.)

### Nominative Endings

As indicated [in the nouns overview](nouns-overview), we determine the **case** and **number** of a noun by identifying its *declension* and then the *ending* of the noun. (A noun's **gender** remains constant, indicated by the dictionary entry.)

There are three declensions, and within each declension, there are a variety of endings that indicate that a noun is in the nominative case, in either the singular or plural.

#### First Declension

| Sub-Group | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| long feminine | -ᾱ, -η | -αι |
| short feminine | -α | -αι |
| masculine | -ας, -ης | -αι |

Within the first declension, there are three sub-groups that depend on

Do notice, however, that all nouns of the first declension have a **nominative plural** ending of **-αι**.


#### Second Declension

| Sub-Group | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| masculine/feminine | -ος | -οι |
| neuter | -ον | -α |

#### Third Declension

| Sub-Group | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| masculine/feminine | -ς, -- | -ες |
| neuter | -- | -α |

## The Definite Article: ὁ, ἡ, τό

In Greek, the **definite article** is used with a noun to indicate that we're talking about a specific noun. Its translation defaults to the English "the", but it can also be used to indicate possession (e.g., ἡ γνώμη = "the opinion" or "my/your/their [etc.] opinion") or stand alone as a pronoun (on which we'll learn more in the unit on pronouns).



### Predicative and Attributive Position



***

## The Verb εἰμί

As mentioned above, the verb "to be" is not strictly needed to form a complete Greek sentence, since using the predicative position does the work of the linking verb for you. The verb can be made explicit, though, by using forms of the verb εἰμί, an irregular verb. This means that its forms are
