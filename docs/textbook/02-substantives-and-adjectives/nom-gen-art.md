## Case Uses: Nominative and Genitive

As indicated [in the nouns overview](nouns-overview), the **case** of a noun indicates its function within a sentence, and the case is indicated by the ending on the noun. The function of the specific case is called a **use**, so we can speak about, e.g., the "uses" of the nominative or the "uses" of the accusative.

The noun's dictionary entry gives you two forms of the noun (nominative singular and genitive singular), so let's explore what each case can do.

### Nominative
{: .no_toc }
The **nominative** is named after the Latin noun *nomen*, or "name." Thus, the nominative is the "naming" case of a noun and gives us the first part of the dictionary entry, which we use to alphabetize our dictionaries.

There are only two **uses** of the nominative:
* **subject**. The nominative case of the noun can make it function as the *subject* of a verb, either the actor of an active verb (e.g., "**The army** *marches* to the sea") or the receiver of the action of a middle/passive verb (e.g., "**The army** *is seen* by the citizens"). (You'll learn all about verbs and active versus middle/passive in a later module.)
* **predicate nominative**. The simplest type of sentence using a *linking verb* (like the verb "to be") to equate two things. For example, "The word is the gift." In this sentence, the linking verb "is" connects "the gift" back to the subject "the word" and indicates that they refer to the same thing. While "the word" is the subject (and thus would be in the nominative case), "the gift" serves as a **predicate nominative**, a word or phrase in the *predicate* of the sentence (e.g., the part of the sentence that follows the verb in English) that gets linked back to the subject.
  * The verb "to be" does exist in Greek, but we'll learn about it at a later date. It is actually technically not necessary to form a full Greek sentence, since it can be left out but understood by context. So, the sentence "The word is the gift" can be rendered as follows: ὁ λόγος τὸ δῶρον. (More on "the" at the end of this module.)

There are quite a few **uses** of the genitive, but we'll focus on only one for now:
* **possession**. The genitive case is used to indicate who possesses or owns another noun. Often, the genitive in this instance can be translated with the preposition "of" (e.g., "the home **of the man**") or with an apostrophe, as in English possession. Note the following Greek to English renderings:
  * ἡ οἰκία **τοῦ ἀνδρός**, "The home **of the man**"
  * οἱ λόγοι **τῆς γυναικός**, "The words **of the woman**"

When the genitive is used in this way,
