## Verbal Aspect

Before we discuss how we can use an infinitive in a sentence, we have to nuance one feature of the verb that we've learned about so far: **tense**. In a **finite** verb, tense indicates *when* the action of the verb happens in an absolute sense (meaning in terms of "real time"). The **present tense** indicates that a verb's action is happening *now*, while the **aorist tense** indicates that a verb's action is a completed one-and-done event of the past.

In non-finite verb forms like infinitives and particples, however, the tense of the verb form means something slightly different. In infinitives and participles, tense indicates the **aspect** of a verb, a quality of the verb that indicates its **duration** and/or its state of **completeness**.

Verb forms built on the **1st principal part** have **present aspect**, which means that the verbal action takes place **over a period of time** and/or is **incomplete/in progress**.

Verb forms built on the **3rd and 6th principal parts** have **aorist(ic) aspect**, which means that the verbal action is **instantaneous** and/or is **completed/done**.

Aspect can also indicate a verbal action's **relative** time in comparison to the action of the main verb of a sentence. **Present aspect** can indicate that the verb form's action is happening **at the same time** as the main verb's action; **aoristic aspect** can indicate that the verb form's action happened **before** the main verb's action.

## Uses of the Infinitive

As mentioned in the first section, infinitives are verbal nouns that can fulfill functions that regular nouns do. Unlike regular nouns, infinitives do not get declined. However, like nouns, they have a gender and a number (**neuter singular**), they have a case that corresponds to a function within a sentence, and they can be used with appropriate forms of the definite article, especially when they serve as objects of prepositions or are in the genitive or dative cases.

### Accusative Subject

In all of the following uses, the actor of the infinitive's action (if active or middle) or the entity receiving the verb's action (if passive) goes into the **accusative case** and is called a **subject accusative** or **accusative subject**. This can be confusing, since an accusative noun can *also* still indicate that it's a direct object of the infinitive. Context will help you determine which of the uses of the accusative, direct object or subject accusative, is appropriate for each noun.

## Subjective Infinitive

A **subjective infinitive**, as the name implies, serves as the subject of a sentence. Most often, the main verb of such sentences that would take a subject infinitive is an **impersonal verb**, one that in English uses a dummy subject "it" and is most often 3rd person singular. Note the examples in the [Unit Vocabulary](#unit-vocabulary) above: δεῖ and χρή, which both mean "it is necessary"; πρέπει, "it is fitting"; and ἔξεστι(ν), a form of εἰμί with the prefix ἐξ, "it is possible." Recall also a verb from Module 1, δοκέω, which in the 3rd singular means "it seems best." You can also use the neuter singular of an adjective in predicative position to fulfill the same role as an impersonal verb. For example, δίκαιον, "it is just", or ἄδικον, "it is unjust."

Here are some examples and explanations.

* δεῖ τὸν μαθητὴν τούσδε τοὺς λόγους ἀκούειν.
    * It is necessary that the student hear these words.

The infinitive ἀκούειν is a subjective infinitive used with the impersonal verb δεῖ. At its core, the idea of the sentence is "it is necessary to hear" -- τὸν μαθητὴν and τούσδε τοὺς λόγους just add additional information. Another way to rewrite the core of the sentence to make it clear that the infitive is subject would be "to hear is necessary" or "hearing is necessary."

The addition of the accusative subject τὸν μαθητὴν and the direct object τούσδε τοὺς λόγους help fill out the picture of what it is necessary to hear and who it's necessary for; they take advantage of the *verbal* part of the infinitive. As a result, in translation, we can turn an infinitive phrase that contains an accusative subject and other predicate features like direct objects or prepositional phrases into their own dependent clauses beginning with the linking word "that", as we see above.

The whole infinitive unit functionally serves as the subject of δεῖ. What is necessary? *The idea that the student hear these words.*

* χρὴ τὰ ἔργα ποιεῖσθαι.

This sentence is comprised of three main units: the main verb χρή, the accusative τὰ ἔργα, and the present middle/passive infinitive ποιεῖσθαι. Because there are different possibilities for the latter two parts (i.e., the accusative can either be a direct object or an accusative subject, and the infinitive can be either middle or passive), there are a few different possibilities for translation.

* If we assume that τὰ ἔργα is a direct object and that ποιεῖσθαι is middle: "It is necessary to do the deeds." In this case, we wouldn't get an explicit subject for the infinitive.
* If we assume that τὰ ἔργα is an accusative subject and that ποιεῖσθαι is passive: "It is necessary that the deeds be done."

### Dative of Reference

Often, a substantive in the dative case can be used to indicate to whom a statement applies. This is a use of the dative called the **dative of reference**, and it often appears in sentences with a subjective infinitive and an impersonal verb. Take a look at the following examples:

* ἄδικον **τοῖς πολῖταις** τὸ πρᾶγμα.
   * The deed is unjust **to/for the citizens**.

* δοκεῖ **τῷ ἀγαθῷ** εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν ἔρχεσθαι.
    * It seems best **to/for the noble person** to come into the house.

## Complementary Infinitive

An infinitive can also *complete* the action of a verb in a predicative fashion, rather than the subjective fashion discussed above. **Complementary infinitives** function as objects rather than subjects in their sentences, and the verbs that necessitate complementary infinitives tend to be more active and transitive than the impersonal verbs discussed above. For example, note ἐθέλω, "to want", in the [Unit Vocabulary](#unit-vocabulary) above. Also, verbs of commanding like κελεύω, "to order", can take a complementary infinitive as well (in addition usually to an accusative subject).

Note the following examples:

* οἱ πολῖται ἐθέλουσιν **αἱρεῖν** τὰ ὅπλα.
    * The citizens wish **to take** the weapons.

In this sentence, the

* ὁ διδάσκαλος κελεύει τοὺς μαθητὰς ἀγαθὰ λέγειν.
