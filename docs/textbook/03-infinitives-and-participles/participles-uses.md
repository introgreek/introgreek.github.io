## Uses of Participles

Participles are **verbal adjectives**, meaning that they tell us more about a noun. At their core, they are descriptive, but as we'll see, based on a participle's position within a sentence, it can also serve additional adverbial purposes, meaning that the participial phrase qualifies the *verb*'s action in addition to modifying a noun.

Because they are derived from verbs, participles can do things like take **direct objects** and **prepositional phrases**. The *actor* of an *active/middle* participle or *the one receiving the action* of a *passive* participle is **the noun that the participle modifies**. We'll illustrate this through the specific examples below.

There are three major ways in which participles can be used and interpreted within a sentence.
* An **attributive participle** acts like a pure adjective and tells us about an action that the modified noun is performing (if active or middle) or that the modified noun is experiencing (if passive).
* A **circumstantial participle**, in addition to modifying a noun, also explains the *circumstances* of the action of a main verb and answer questions like "when did it happen?" or "why did it happen?"
* A **complementary participle**, in addition to modifying a noun, also *completes* the meaning of certain main verbs, including some verbs of speech in a construction called indirect statement.

## Attributive Participles

An **attributive participle** acts like a pure adjective and tells us about an action that the modified noun is performing (if active or middle) or that the modified noun is experiencing (if passive). As the name implies, a participle of this sort is usually (though not always) in [**attributive position**](../nouns/attr-pred#attributive-position). Note the following examples.

* ὁ παῖς **ὁ τοὺς ἵππους ἄγων** τὰ βιβλία φέρει.

The participial phrase here centers on the present active participle ἄγων, which is masculine nominative singular and is in attributive position with the noun that it modifies, ὁ παῖς. Because ἄγων agrees with παῖς and because ἄγων is in the active voice, the action of "leading" in the participle is being performed by the "child." Note also that wedged in between the repeated article and the participle is an accusative direct object, τοὺς ἵππους, that receives the action of "leading" in ἄγων. So, when we put all of those ideas together, we can come up with a translation like this:

* The child **leading the horses** carries the books.

However, this kind of participle translation doesn't necessarily indicate that you understand how the participle relates to the other parts of the sentence: for example, that it is an attributive participle versus a circumstantial participle (which we'll talk about in the next section). So, when you interpret a participle as being an attributive one, one surefire way to communicate that is by translating it as a **relative clause**, a "who", "which", or "that" clause that functions adjectivally to tell us more about a noun:

* The child **who leads the horses** carries the books.

This translation of the participle expands it beyond a simple "[verb]ing" or "[verb]ed" with the addition of a **relative pronoun** ("who", "which", or "that") and the casting of the participle as a conjugated verb ("leads"), and it indicates more clearly how the participle functions within the sentence. The importance of this clarity will become clear once we see how versatile the participle can be in other contexts, as in circumstantial uses of the participle. (We will learn more about relative pronouns and actual relative clauses in the next module.)

* μίκρα τὰ **ὑπὸ τοῦ παῖδος φερόμενα** βιβλία.

In this example, the present passive participle φερόμενα, neuter nominative plural from φέρω, and its genitive of agent ὑπὸ τοῦ παῖδος are in the attributive position between τὰ and its noun βιβλία. Outside of that article-noun phrase is the predicate nominative μίκρα (in [predicative position](../nouns/attr-pred#predicative-position), to form a full sentence).

* The books **that are carried by the child** are small.

Because we have such latitude in translation, there are many possibilities and we don't need to be limited to just one "correct" translation:

* The books **which are carried by the child** are small.
* The books **that are being carried by the child** are small.
etc.
