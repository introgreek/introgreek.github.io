## Uses of Participles

Participles are **verbal adjectives**, meaning that they tell us more about a noun. At their core, they are descriptive, but as we'll see, based on a participle's position within a sentence, it can also serve additional adverbial purposes, meaning that the participial phrase qualifies the *verb*'s action in addition to modifying a noun.

Because they are derived from verbs, participles can do things like take **direct objects** and **prepositional phrases**. The *actor* of an *active/middle* participle or *the one receiving the action* of a *passive* participle is **the noun that the participle modifies**. We'll illustrate this through the specific examples below.

There are three major ways in which participles can be used and interpreted within a sentence.
* An **attributive participle** acts like a pure adjective and tells us about an action that the modified noun is performing (if active or middle) or that the modified noun is experiencing (if passive).
* A **circumstantial participle**, in addition to modifying a noun, also explains the *circumstances* of the action of a main verb and answer questions like "when did it happen?" or "why did it happen?"
* A **complementary participle**, in addition to modifying a noun, also *completes* the meaning of certain main verbs, including some verbs of speech in a construction called indirect statement.

## Attributive Participles

An **attributive participle** acts like a pure adjective and tells us about an action that the modified noun is performing (if active or middle) or that the modified noun is experiencing (if passive). As the name implies, a participle of this sort is usually (though not always) in [**attributive position**](../nouns/attr-pred#attributive-position). Note the following examples.

* ὁ παῖς **ὁ τοὺς ἵππους ἄγων** τὰ βιβλία φέρει.

The participial phrase here centers on the present active participle ἄγων, which is masculine nominative singular and is in attributive position with the noun that it modifies, ὁ παῖς. Because ἄγων agrees with παῖς and because ἄγων is in the active voice, the action of "leading" in the participle is being performed by the "child." Note also that wedged in between the repeated article and the participle is an accusative direct object, τοὺς ἵππους, that receives the action of "leading" in ἄγων. So, when we put all of those ideas together, we can come up with a translation like this:

* The child **leading the horses** carries the books.

However, this kind of participle translation doesn't necessarily indicate that you understand how the participle relates to the other parts of the sentence: for example, that it is an attributive participle versus a circumstantial participle (which we'll talk about in the next section). So, when you interpret a participle as being an attributive one, one surefire way to communicate that is by translating it as a **relative clause**, a "who", "which", or "that" clause that functions adjectivally to tell us more about a noun:

* The child **who leads the horses** carries the books.

This translation of the participle expands it beyond a simple "[verb]ing" or "[verb]ed" with the addition of a **relative pronoun** ("who", "which", or "that") and the casting of the participle as a conjugated verb ("leads"), and it indicates more clearly how the participle functions within the sentence. The importance of this clarity will become clear once we see how versatile the participle can be in other contexts, as in circumstantial uses of the participle. (We will learn more about relative pronouns and actual relative clauses in the next module.)

* μίκρα τὰ **ὑπὸ τοῦ παῖδος φερόμενα** βιβλία.

In this example, the present passive participle φερόμενα, neuter nominative plural from φέρω, and its genitive of agent ὑπὸ τοῦ παῖδος are in the attributive position between τὰ and its noun βιβλία. Outside of that article-noun phrase is the predicate nominative μίκρα (in [predicative position](../nouns/attr-pred#predicative-position), to form a full sentence).

* The books **that are carried by the child** are small.

Because we have such latitude in translation, there are many possibilities and we don't need to be limited to just one "correct" translation:

* The books **which are carried by the child** are small.
* The books **that are being carried by the child** are small.
etc.

## A Note on Aspect and Relative Tense

Recall that the tense of participles, like the tense infinitives, indicates [**aspect**](infinitive-uses#verbal-aspect) and thus **relative time to the main verb** rather than **absolute time**. While this distinction is difficult to determine with the infinitive constructions that we currently know, it is much clearer with participial expressions that get expanded into dependent clauses.

* ὁ παῖς ὁ τοὺς ἵππους **ἄγων** τὰ βιβλία **φέρει**.
    * The child who **leads** the horses **carries** the books.
* ὁ παῖς ὁ τοὺς ἵππους **ἄγων** τὰ βιβλία **ἤνεγκεν**.
    * The child who **was leading/led** the horses **carried** the books.

**Present aspect** means that the action of the participle is **in progress**, **incomplete**, and **happening at the same time as the main verb**.

In the first sentence, the present participle ἄγων indicates that the action of "leading" occurs at the same time as the main verb φέρει, which is in the present tense. Therefore, ἄγων gets translated with a present verb: "leads."

We use the same present participle ἄγων in the second sentence, but note that the main verb is now the aorist ἤνεγκεν. Because **present aspect** means that the action occurs **at the same time as the main verb**, that means that our translation necessarily needs to reflect that: thus, we get "was leading" or "led" *rather than* the expected "leads". While "led" (a simple past tense) illustrates the idea that the action of "leading" occurs in the past along with the action of "carrying", the translation "was leading" illustrates the same along with also conveying the participle's **in progress** quality.

* ὁ παῖς ὁ τοὺς ἵππους **ἀγαγὼν** τὰ βιβλία **φέρει**.
    * The child who **led** the horses **carries** the books.
* ὁ παῖς ὁ τοὺς ἵππους **ἀγαγὼν** τὰ βιβλία **ἤνεγκεν**.
    * The child who **had led** the horses **carried** the books.

**Aorist aspect** means that the action of the participle is **instantaneous (one and done)**, **completed**, and **happened before the main verb**.

This is easy enough to see in the first sentence, which maintains the same relationship of time that one would expect between aorist and present: "led" is an instantaneous action that is completed and done before the action of "carrying" happens.

However, in the second sentence, notice how the translation of the aorist participle needs to indicate that it happened *before* the aorist main verb. To make this clear, we can use the English **pluperfect** tense ("**had** [verb]**ed**"), which indicates an action that occurred *before* an action in the past.

Whenever you're translating a participle, you must always think in terms of **duration**, **completeness**, and **relative tense**; you can't take "present" or "aorist" at face value necessarily.

## Circumstantial Participles

**Circumstantial participles** perform double duty in a sentence. They both modify a noun *and* explain the **circumstances** of the action of the main verb. They will also usually be placed in **predicative position** to help differentiate them from attributive participles. Participles of this sort often answer questions like "when does the main verb happen?", "why does it happen?", "what obstacles could impede the main verb from happening?", and "under what condition will the main verb happen?" Although there are some clues that may point to one type of circumstantial participle over another, often it will be a matter of personal interpretation, and you have to make a choice as to which of the following translations makes the most sense in the context of what you're reading.

### Temporal
If a circumstantial participle functions in a **temporal** fashion, it is answering the "when" question -- "temporal" derives from the Latin *tempus*, "time". The way that the participle answers the question (i.e., to indicate at what time the main verb occurred) depends on its tense/aspect.

* Either tense of the participle may be translated with **"when"**.
* Present participles may be translated with **"while"** or **"as"**.
* Aorist participles may be translated with **"after"**.

We'll illustrate this idea by using the same sentence with various tenses.

ὁ πολίτης βλέπει τὴν οἰκίαν **ἐρχόμενος ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ**.
* The citizen sees the house **when he comes from the road**.
* The citizen sees the house **while he comes from the road**.
* The citizen sees the house **as he comes from the road**.

In each of these three sample translations, the conjunctions "when", "while", and "as" indicate the relationship of time between the present participle ἐρχόμενος and the main verb βλέπει -- because the participle has present aspect, the two verb actions are happening at the same time.

Notice that because the participle is outside of attributive position, we have to be careful about who/what the participle modifies. Because ἐρχόμενος is masculine nominative singular, the only noun that it can modify is πολίτης -- it is the *citizen* who is coming, not the house (οἰκίαν), which is feminine accusative singular, despite the fact that οἰκίαν is the closest noun to ἐρχόμενος.

ὁ πολίτης βλέπει τὴν οἰκίαν **ἐλθὼν ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ**.
* The citizen sees the house **when he came from the road**.
* The citizen sees the house **after he came from the road**.
