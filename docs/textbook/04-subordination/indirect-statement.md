## Indirect Statement

An **indirect statement** is a phrase that reports what someone says or thinks through the filter of a main verb performed by the head (e.g., "to say", "to think", "to shout"). Here's an example in English:

* He says that the sky is blue.

In this sentence, the direct form of the thought is "the sky is blue." However, it is getting filtered through a main verb of speaking, "he says", and a bridge word "that."

In Greek, there are three different ways to form an indirect statement, and the method that we use depends on **what main verb introduces the indirect statement**. In the [Unit Vocabulary](#unit-vocabulary) above, note that the subheadings indicate some verbs that can take specific constructions. Some of them can take more than one of the constructions about to be described, but for now, we will limit them to one construction so as to focus on the details of the construction itself.

## ὅτι / ὡς

After verbs like λέγω ("to say, speak"), ἀγγέλλω ("to announce"), and μανθάνω ("to learn"), an indirect statement can essentially take the exact same form that it does in its direct version, but preceded by the conjunction ὅτι or ὡς, which essentially is translated as the "that" in an English indirect statement. Note the following examples:

* ὁ παῖς τοὺς ἵππους ἄγει. The child leads the horses.
* ἡ γυνὴ λέγει *ὅτι* **ὁ παῖς τοὺς ἵππους ἄγει**. The woman says *that* **the child leads the horses**.

Note how the second sentence has three parts. The **main verb of the head** (in this case λέγει) introduces the indirect statement. **ὅτι** serves as a bridge between the main verb and the actual substance of the indirect statement. Then, the indirect statement is copied verbatim from its direct version in the first sentence: ὁ παῖς τοὺς ἵππους ἄγει.

Generally, the verb of an indirect statement introduced by ὅτι / ὡς will retain the same **tense and voice** as its direct form, but under circumstances, the **person** of the verb may change, depending on the perspective of the subject of the main head verb in the indirect statement. For example:

* γράφομεν τὰ ποιήματα. We are writing the poems.
* ἐκεῖνοι ἀγγέλλουσιν *ὡς* ***γράφουσι*** **τὰ ποιήματα**. Those people announce *that* ***they are writing*** **the poems**.

The perspective has changed between the direct version and the indirect version. In the direct version, the first person plural verb offers what "we" are doing, but in the indirect version, someone is reporting the words of that group from an outside perspective. The speaker is *not* part of the first person plural group, so this necessitates a change to the third person.

### Sequence of Moods Preview

Next semester, we will learn about a rule called the **sequence of moods** that offers some variation on the ὅτι / ὡς construction and governs what **mood** a verb can be in in a dependent clause. In short, the main verb of the head can belong to one of two tense classes: **primary**, which includes the present, future, perfect, and future perfect tenses [i.e., any non-past tense]; or **secondary**, which includes the imperfect, aorist, and pluperfect tenses [i.e., any past tense]. If the main verb of the head is in a *secondary* tense, you may optionally change the verb of an indirect statement into the **optative** mood while retaining the same tense and voice. For example:

* ἐκεῖνοι ἀγγέλλουσιν ὡς **γράφουσι** τὰ ποιήματα. Those people announce that **they are writing** the poems.
* ἐκεῖνοι *ἤγγειλαν* ὡς **γράφοιεν** τὰ ποιήματα. Those people *announced* that **they are/were writing** the poems.

The formation of the optative involves new endings and new sentence constructions, and the sequence of moods will factor into new syntactic structures like purpose clauses and conditionals.
