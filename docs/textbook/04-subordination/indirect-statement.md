## Indirect Statement

An **indirect statement** is a phrase that reports what someone says or thinks through the filter of a main verb performed by the head (e.g., "to say", "to think", "to shout"). Here's an example in English:

* He says that the sky is blue.

In this sentence, the direct form of the thought is "the sky is blue." However, it is getting filtered through a main verb of speaking, "he says", and a bridge word "that."
