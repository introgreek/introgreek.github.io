## Relative Clauses

A **relative clause** is a *dependent clause* that modifies a noun, much like an adjective. A dependent clause is usually introduced by a subordinating conjunction or a pronoun that can begin a clause that contains its own conjugated verb; in this case, a **relative clause** begins with a **relative pronoun**: ὅς, ἥ, ὅ - "who", "which", or "that". Note the following example in English:

* The book **which is on the table** is large.

The **relative clause** in this sentence begins with the **relative pronoun** "which" and continues with the remainder of the clause: the conjugated verb "is" and the prepositional phrase "on the table." The relative clause serves to tell us more about a noun, in this case "the book," and the relative clause helps us understand which book in particular we're talking about: the book **which is on the table**, as opposed to the book which is on the shelf or the book that is blue. This noun gets replaced in the relative clause with the **relative pronoun**. This noun is termed an **antecedent**, which, as you will recall from the unit on [pronouns](../nouns/pronouns), will give the pronoun its **gender** and **number**; the **case** of the pronoun, however, comes from its use within its own clause. More on this below.

## Relative Pronoun

The **relative pronoun**, like any other pronoun, can exist in any combination of **gender**, **case**, and **number**, since it needs to be able to replace any kind of noun. Its declension
