## Contract Verbs Refresher

As we learned from the [epsilon-contract verbs unit](../verbs/epsilon-contracts) from last semester, verb forms created from the **first principal part** (i.e., present tense and imperfect tense forms) will have an extra step in the conjugation or declension process **if the 1st pp stem ends in an epsilon**. That stem's epsilon must **contract** with the initial vowel of the ending that follows it to create a new vowel sound. For example:

* ποιέω > stem ποιε-

If we wanted to create the masculine genitive singular present active participle of this verb (with the ending -οντος):

* ποι**ε**- + -**ο**ντος = ποι**οῦ**ντος

The -ε- of the stem and the -ο- of the ending combine into the diphthong -ου- in the participle's final form.

Here is the full list of epsilon contractions. We used the first four last semester, and the remaining ones are new ones that we are going to need for new verb forms this semester:

Semester 1:
* ε + ει = ει
* ε + ου = ου
* ε + ε = ει
* ε + ο = ου
* ε + ω = ω

Semester 2:
* ε + ᾱ = η
* ε + α = η
* ε + η = η
* ε + αι = ῃ
* ε + ῃ = ῃ
* ε + οι = οι
* ε + ῳ = ῳ

## Alpha- and Omicron-Contracts

As indicated last semester, epsilon is not the only letter at the end of a first principal part stem that triggers a contraction; the same process needs to occur if the stem ends in an **alpha** or an **omicron** as well. However, due to the different phonological qualities of an alpha or an omicron compared to an epsilon, the combinations that result will necessarily be different than those that epsilon creates.

A full list of contractions for epsilons, alphas, and omicrons can be found [in the reference section](../../reference/contractions) of our site. Here is a list of both alpha and omicron contractions, beginning with those that apply directly to ending vowels that we learned about in the first semester and continuing with those that we will make use of later in this current semester.

Combinations for Semester 1 endings:
* α + ει = ᾳ (note the iota subscript)\*
* α + ε = α (long alpha)
* α + ου = ω
* α + ο = ω
* α + ω = ω
* ο + ει = οι
* ο + ε = ου
* ο + ου = ου
* ο + ο = ου
* ο + ω = ω

\* There is a specific exception for this: the -ει- of the **present active infinitive ending -ειν** is linguistically dissimilar to the -ει of the 3rd person singular present active ending, so it results in a different contraction: -α-. Thus, the present active infinitive of the verb ὁράω is **ὁρᾶν** (no iota subscript).

Combinations for later this semester:
* α + ᾱ = ᾱ
* α + α = ᾱ
* α + η = ᾱ
* α + αι = αι
* α + ῃ = ᾳ
* α + οι = ῳ
* ο + οι = οι
* ο + ῃ = οι
* ο + η = ω
* ο + ῳ = ῳ

## ὁράω

One of the most common alpha-contract verbs is ὁράω, "to see."
