## Contract Verbs Refresher

As we learned from the [epsilon-contract verbs unit](../verbs/epsilon-contracts) from last semester, verb forms created from the **first principal part** (i.e., present tense and imperfect tense forms) will have an extra step in the conjugation or declension process **if the 1st pp stem ends in an epsilon**. That stem's epsilon must **contract** with the initial vowel of the ending that follows it to create a new vowel sound. For example:

* ποιέω > stem ποιε-

If we wanted to create the masculine genitive singular present active participle of this verb (with the ending -οντος):

* ποι**ε**- + -**ο**ντος = ποι**οῦ**ντος

The -ε- of the stem and the -ο- of the ending combine into the diphthong -ου- in the participle's final form.

Here is the full list of epsilon contractions. We used the first four last semester, and the remaining ones are new ones that we are going to need for new verb forms this semester:

Semester 1:
* ε + ει = ει
* ε + ου = ου
* ε + ε = ει
* ε + ο = ου
* ε + ω = ω

Semester 2:
* ε + ᾱ = η
* ε + α = η
* ε + η = η
* ε + αι = ῃ
* ε + ῃ = ῃ
* ε + οι = οι
* ε + ῳ = ῳ

### Practice Opportunity 1

Generate the requested fully-contracted form of the verb ποιέω.

1. 2nd pl. imperfect middle/passive
2. neut. acc. pl., present active participle
3. present middle/passive infinitive
4. masc. nom. sg., present active participle
5. 1st pl. present active
6.

## Alpha- and Omicron-Contracts

As indicated last semester, epsilon is not the only letter at the end of a first principal part stem that triggers a contraction; the same process needs to occur if the stem ends in an **alpha** or an **omicron** as well. However, due to the different phonological qualities of an alpha or an omicron compared to an epsilon, the combinations that result will necessarily be different than those that epsilon creates.

A full list of contractions for epsilons, alphas, and omicrons can be found [in the reference section](../../reference/contractions) of our site. Here is a list of both alpha and omicron contractions, beginning with those that apply directly to ending vowels that we learned about in the first semester and continuing with those that we will make use of later in this current semester.

Semester 1 Endings:
* α + ει = ᾳ (note the iota subscript) (3rd sg. pres. act.)
* α + ε = α (long alpha) (3rd sg. impf. act.)
* α + ου = ω
* α + ο = ω
* ο + ει = οι
* ο + ε = ου
* ο + ου = ου
* ο + ο = ου

### ὁράω

One of the most common alpha-contract verbs is ὁράω, "to see."
