## Athematic Aorists

The core four -μι verbs that we learned about [in the previous unit](athematic) along with four -ω verbs exhibit a third principal part that conjugates in the aorist active and middle with **athematic conjugation patterns**. This means that for these verbs, we cannot simply classify its third principal part as [first aorist](../verbs/first-aorist) or [second aorist](../verbs/second-aorist) and apply the appropriate endings; we have to take special stem changes and athematic endings into account.

A quick reminder of the **secondary tense endings for athematic verbs**:

| | Secondary Tense Act. | Secondary Tense Middle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | -ν | -μην |
| 2nd sg. | -ς | -σο |
| 3rd sg. | -- | -το |
| 1st pl. | -μεν | -μεθα |
| 2nd pl. | -τε | -σθε |
| 3rd pl. | -σαν | -ντο |

* secondary active infinitive: -ναι
* secondary active participle: -ς, -σα, -ν (m./n. stem -ντ-)
* secondary middle infinitive: -σθαι
* secondary middle participle: -μενος, -μένη, -μενον

## -ω Verbs with Athematic Aorists

Four -ω verbs have **athematic aorists** are βαίνω, γιγνώσκω, δύω, and ἁλίσκομαι, along with any compounds formed from those verbs (like διαβαίνω from the [Result Clauses unit](../syntax-2/result-clauses)). Note that this affects only the forms of these verbs built on the third principal part; the present tense of these verbs, for example, is conjugated according to thematic patterns.

Note that the third principal part of each of these verbs does not end in the characteristic -(σ)α of first aorists or -ον of second aorists; rather, each ends with the athematic 1st sg. ending of -ν, which is attached to a stem that exhibits a long vowel.
