## Athematic Verb Review

Verbs belong to one of two major conjugations: **-ω** / **thematic** or **-μι** / **athematic**. The former exhibits

## Core Four -μι Verbs

The most common -μι verbs are δίδωμι, τίθημι, ἵημι, and ἵστημι. Each of these verbs follows general athematic conjugation patterns, but the *stem* of the verb in the first principal part (and also in the third, as we'll learn later) ends in a vowel that will *change length* depending on the tense, voice, and number of the verb.

Some general patterns to note:
* These verbs will use the **long vowel stem** in the present and imperfect active singular forms; they will use the **short vowel stem** otherwise.
* All verbs have present infinitive endings **-ναι** for active and **-σθαι** for middle/passive attached directly to the **short vowel stem**.
  * The active infinitive is accented persistently on the syllable before -ναι; the middle/passive infinitive is accented recessively.
* The present active participles for each are listed below under the appropriate verb.
* The present middle/passive participles are formed by attaching **-μενος, -μενη, -μενον** to the **short vowel stem**.

### ἵστημι

* Stem: ἱστη- / ἱστα-
* present active infinitive: ἱστάναι
* present active participle: ἱστάς, ἱστᾶσα, ἱστάν (m./n. stem ἱσταντ-)
* present middle/passive infinitive: ἵστασθαι
* present middle/passive participle: ἱστάμενος, -η, -ον

| | Present Active | Present Mid./Pass. | Imperfect Active | Imperfect Mid./Pass |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ἵστημι | ἵσταμαι | ἵστην | ἱστάμην |
| 2nd sg. | ἵστης | ἵστασαι | ἵστης | ἵστασο |
| 3rd sg. | ἵστησι(ν) | ἵσταται | ἵστη | ἵστατο |
| 1st pl. | ἵσταμεν | ἱστάμεθα | ἵσταμεν | ἱστάμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | ἵστατε | ἵστασθε | ἵστατε | ἵστασθε |
| 3rd pl. | ἱστᾶσι(ν)\* | ἵστανται | ἵστασαν | ἵσταντο |

\* In the 3rd pl. pres. act. of ἵστημι, note that the -ε- of the root and the -α- of the ending contract into -ᾱ-.  

### δίδωμι

* Stem: διδω- / διδο-
* present active infinitive: διδόναι
* present active participle: διδούς, διδοῦσα, διδόν (m./n. stem διδόντ-)
* present middle/passive infinitive: διδόσθαι
* present middle/passive participle: διδόμενος, -η, -ον

| | Present Active | Present Mid./Pass. | Imperfect Active | Imperfect Mid./Pass |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | δίδωμι | δίδομαι | ἐδίδουν\* | ἐδιδόμην |
| 2nd sg. | δίδως | δίδοσαι | ἐδίδους\* | ἐδίδοσο |
| 3rd sg. | δίδωσι(ν) | δίδοται | ἐδίδου\* | ἐδίδοτο |
| 1st pl. | δίδομεν | διδόμεθα | ἐδίδομεν | ἐδιδόμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | δίδοτε | δίδοσθε | ἐδίδοτε | ἐδίδοσθε |
| 3rd pl. | διδόασι(ν) | δίδονται | ἐδίδοσαν | ἐδίδοντο |

\* Note that these forms are uncharacteristically built on the short vowel stem and borrow their endings from thematic verbs, including theme vowels that get contracted with the athematic verb stem (ἐδιδο- + -ον = ἐδίδουν; ἐδιδο- + -ες = ἐδίδους; ἐδιδο- + -ε = ἐδίδου).

### τίθημι

* Stem: τιθη- / τιθε-
* present active infinitive: τιθέναι
* present active participle: τιθείς, τιθεῖσα, τιθέν (m./n. stem τιθέντ-)
* present middle/passive infinitive: τίθεσθαι
* present middle/passive participle: τιθέμενος, -η, -ον

| | Present Active | Present Mid./Pass. | Imperfect Active | Imperfect Mid./Pass |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | τίθημι | τίθεμαι | ἐτίθην | ἐτιθέμην |
| 2nd sg. | τίθης | τίθεσαι | ἐτίθεις\* | ἐτίθεσο |
| 3rd sg. | τίθησι(ν) | τίθεται | ἐτίθει\* | ἐτίθετο |
| 1st pl. | τίθεμεν | τιθέμεθα | ἐτίθεμεν | ἐτιθέμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | τίθετε | τίθεσθε | ἐτίθετε | ἐτίθεσθε |
| 3rd pl. | τιθέασι(ν) | τίθενται | ἐτίθεσαν | ἐτίθεντο |

\* As above with δίδωμι, note that these forms are uncharacteristically built on the short vowel stem and borrow their endings from thematic verbs, including theme vowels that get contracted with the athematic verb stem (ἐτιθε- + -ες = ἐτίθεις; ἐτιθε- + -ε = ἐτίθει).

### ἵημι

* Stem: ἱη- / ἱε-
* present active infinitive: ἱέναι
* present active participle: ἱείς, ἱεῖσα, ἱέν (m./n. stem ἱέντ-)
* present middle/passive infinitive: ἵεσθαι
* present middle/passive participle: ἱέμενος, -η, -ον

| | Present Active | Present Mid./Pass. | Imperfect Active | Imperfect Mid./Pass |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ἵημι | ἵεμαι | ἵην | ἱέμην |
| 2nd sg. | ἵης | ἵεσαι | ἵεις\*\* | ἵεσο |
| 3rd sg. | ἵησι(ν) | ἵεται | ἵει\*\* | ἵετο |
| 1st pl. | ἵεμεν | ἱέμεθα | ἵεμεν | ἱέμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | ἵετε | ἵεσθε | ἵετε | ἵεσθε |
| 3rd pl. | ἱᾶσι(ν)\* | ἵενται | ἵεσαν | ἵεντο |

\* As in ἵστημι, in the 3rd pl. pres. act. of ἵημι, note that the -ε- of the root and the -α- of the ending contract into -ᾱ-.  
\*\* Note that as in δίδωμι and τίθημι, the 2nd and 3rd sg. imperfect active are built on the short vowel stem and borrow their endings from thematic verbs (ἱε- + -ες = ἵεις; ἱε- + -ε = ἵει).
