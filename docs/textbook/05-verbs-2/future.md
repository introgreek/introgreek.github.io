## Future Tense Overview

The **future** tense, as discussed [in the verb overview](overview#verb-aspects), indicates an action that has yet to happen, i.e., it will happen *in the future*. The future tense can contain both aoristic and present aspects, meaning the future action can be a one-and-done or ongoing event. Here are a few examples:

* "They **will order**"
* "They **will be ordering**"
* "They **are going to order**"
* "They **shall order**"

These are all variations of the future tense of the verb "to order"; all of these actions will occur. Each is expressed slightly differently but equally as valid for indicating that core concept: that the verbal action in question has yet to happen and is not currently occurring.

Like the other tenses that you already know, the future tense can be expressed in any of the three voices. For example:

* active: "They will order"
* middle: "They will order (for themselves)"
* passive: "They will be ordered"

The future tense, however, is akin to the aorist tense, in that the **future active and middle voices** are built on *one* principal part, **the 2nd**, while the **future passive voice** is built on **the 6th**. This means that you need to return to the verbs that we learned about in the first semester and begin memorizing their **2nd principal parts**.

## Future Active and Middle

As mentioned above, the **future active and middle voices** are built on the **2nd principal part**. The easy part about forming these voices is that you already know the personal endings to apply to the verb stem: they are exactly identical to the **present tense -ω** endings from last semester.

| | Active | Middle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | -ω | -ομαι |
| 2nd sg. | -εις | -ῃ |
| 3rd sg. | -ει | -εται |
| 1st pl. | -ομεν | -όμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | -ετε | -εσθε |
| 3rd pl. | -ουσι(ν) | -ονται |

You simply need to add these endings to the **future tense stem**, which is the **2nd principal part minus the ending -ω or -ομαι**. So, let's take the verb κελεύω, "to order", as our paradigm example.

| | Active | Middle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | κελεύσω | κελεύσομαι |
| 2nd sg. | κελεύσεις | κελεύσῃ |
| 3rd sg. | κελεύσει | κελεύσεται |
| 1st pl. | κελεύσομεν | κελευσόμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | κελεύσετε | κελεύσεσθε |
| 3rd pl. | κελεύσουσι(ν) | κελεύσονται |

### Fut. Act. and Mid. Infinitives and Participles

Similary, the endings for the future active and middle infinitives and participles are exactly the same as those for **present tense -ω** verbs, but added to the **future stem** of the **2nd principal part**. So, if we keep using our paradigm verb κελεύω:

* future active infinitive: κελεύσειν
* future active participle: κελεύσων, κελεύσουσα, κελεῦσον (m./n. stem κελευσοντ-)
* future middle infinitive: κελεύσεσθαι
* future middle participle: κελευσόμενος, κελευσομένη, κελευσόμενον

## Future Passive

The **future passive** is built on the **6th principal part**, which you used last semester also to build the aorist passive. Because the future tense is a *primary* tense (i.e., not a past tense), we need to **un-augment** the stem of the 6th principal part in the same way that we would if we were forming an infinitive or participle from it. For a refresher on how to do that, check out last semester's unit on [aorist infinitives](../infs-and-parts/infinitive-formation#aorist-infinitives)
