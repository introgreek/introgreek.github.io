## Optative Formation

The **optative** is the third out of the four moods of a finite verb that we'll discuss this semester. From the Latin verb *optare*, "to wish", the optative mood often expresses **wishes or circumstances that are even less definite than the subjunctive**.

Like the subjunctive, the **optative** can occur in the aspect tenses (**present**, **aorist**, and **perfect**), but the optative can also occur in the **future** tense, primarily for a specialized use that we'll discuss in the dependent uses of the optative unit. Also like the subjunctive, the optative is built on **unaugmented stems**, and its tense indicates **aspect** rather than absolute time (with the future tense able to indicate either present or aoristic aspect).

Unlike the subjunctive, however, the endings of the optative are **wildly variable** and depend wholly on the tense, voice, and stem type of the verb in question. This unit will present most of the possibilities in detail, but it will be far more important for you to be able to **identify** an optative when you see it rather than being able to **generate** it from a dictionary entry. That said, here are some general similarities amongst the possibilities for optative endings:

* Optative endings will often include the letter(s) **-ι-** or **-ιη** after the thematic vowel (if used) and before the pure personal ending (e.g., -μεν, -τε, etc.).
* Those personal endings are a mix of **primary and secondary -μι verb endings**, with some alternatives and variations in select persons and numbers.

## Optative Ending Groups

The optative endings that a particular verb form will use again depend wholly on the tense, voice, and stem type of the verb in question. The last characteristic includes distinctions like contract verb versus non-contract verb, thematic versus athematic, etc.

Each of the following items groups together tense/voice/stem type combinations that will share the same endings or conjugation patterns:

1. (non-contract) present [-ω and regular -μι]; (non-contract) future; strong/2nd aorist active/middle
2. weak/1st aorist active/middle
3. aorist passive
4. core 4 -μι verbs, athematic aorists, εἰμί
5. contract verbs
6. perfect optative

### Group 1

* (non-contract) present [-ω and regular -μι]
* strong/2nd aorist active/middle
* (non-contract) future [rare]

This group of verbs exhibits a regular set of endings that get attached to the appropriate stem for tense and voice (1st pp for present; 2nd pp for future active/middle; unaugmented 6th pp with -ησ- for future passive; unaugmented 3rd pp for aorist active/middle).

| | Active | Mid./Pass. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | -οιμι | -οίμην |
| 2nd sg. | -οις | -οιο |
| 3rd sg. | -οι | -οιτο |
| 1st pl. | -οιμεν | -οίμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | -οιτε | -οισθε |
| 3rd pl. | -οιεν | -οιντο |

These endings are a combination of the thematic vowel -ο-, the optative marker -ι-, and the secondary -μι endings, with two exceptions: the active 3rd pl. swaps the expected -σαν for -εν, while in the mid./pass. 2nd sg., the expected -οισο drops the intervocalic sigma to create -οιο.

Here is a sample paradigm of the verb ἄγω in each of the possible tense/voice/stem combinations that use these endings.

* ἄγω, ἄξω, ἤγαγον (stem ἀγαγ-) ... ἤχθην (stem ἀχθ-)

| | Pres. Act. Opt. | Pres. Mid./Pass. Opt. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ἄγοιμι | ἀγοίμην |
| 2nd sg. | ἄγοις | ἄγοιο |
| 3rd sg. | ἄγοι | ἄγοιτο |
| 1st pl. | ἄγοιμεν | ἀγοίμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | ἄγοιτε | ἄγοισθε |
| 3rd pl. | ἄγοιεν | ἄγοιντο |

| | Aor. Act. Opt. | Aor. Mid. Opt. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ἀγάγοιμι | ἀγαγοίμην |
| 2nd sg. | ἀγάγοις | ἀγάγοιο |
| 3rd sg. | ἀγάγοι | ἀγάγοιτο |
| 1st pl. | ἀγάγοιμεν | ἀγαγοίμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | ἀγάγοιτε | ἀγάγοισθε |
| 3rd pl. | ἀγάγοιεν | ἀγάγοιντο |

| | Fut. Act. Opt. | Fut. Mid. Opt. | Fut. Pass. Opt. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ἄξοιμι | ἀξοίμην | ἀχθησοίμην |
| 2nd sg. | ἄξοις | ἄξοιο | ἀχθήσοιο |
| 3rd sg. | ἄξοι | ἄξοιτο | ἀχθήσοιτο |
| 1st pl. | ἄξοιμεν | ἀξοίμεθα | ἀχθησοίμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | ἄξοιτε | ἄξοισθε | ἀχθήσοισθε |
| 3rd pl. | ἄξοιεν | ἄξοιντο | ἀχθήσοιντο |
