## Perfect Tense Overview

Compared to the other tenses that you've learned so far (aorist, present, imperfect, and future), the **perfect tense** is more rare, but it will be beneficial to know how to identify it in context and how to translate it.

The **perfect** tense, as discussed [in the verb overview](overview#verb-aspects), indicates an action that occured in the past but has lasting effects into the present. This idea constitutes the third of the three verb **aspects**:

* present aspect: continuous, ongoing, incomplete action
* aorist(ic) aspect: instantaneous, completed action
* **perfect(ive) aspect**: action with effects that last beyond the action's completion

An illustration of perfect aspect is the following example: "He **has been seen**." The act of being seen occurred in the past, but he is still in the state of having been seen in the present tense; he can't be *un*seen.

Thus, the **perfect tense** is best expressed in English using **the auxiliary verb "has/have" with the past participle of the verb**, e.g. "has died", "have seen", "has spoken", "have wanted."

Like the other tenses that you already know, the perfect tense can be expressed in any of the three voices. For example:

* active: "They have ordered"
* middle: "They have ordered (for themselves)"
* passive: "They have been ordered"

The perfect tense will also complete our knowledge of the **principal parts**. The **fourth principal part** is used to conjugate the **perfect active** and also form its infinitive and participles. The **fifth principal part** is used to conjugate the **perfect middle and passive** and also form its infinitive and participles. Thus, the perfect operates similarly to the present tense: it has one form for **active** and one form for both **middle and passive**, so you will need to use context clues to figure out which voice your verb is.

### Fourth and Fifth Principal Part and Perfect Tense Markers

The **perfect tense** in any voice will usually exhibit one tense marker: **reduplication**. Like an augment, **reduplication** affects the beginning of the verb stem, depending on the letter(s) that the verb stem begins with. However, unlike an augment, **reduplication cannot be removed or undone from a perfect tense stem**. This will be important when considering perfect infinitives, participles, and finite forms in the subjunctive or optative, especially since reduplication in some contexts can look like an augment.

## Perfect Active

As mentioned above, the **future active and middle voices** are built on the **2nd principal part**, and you get the stem to which you need to add the personal endings by removing the **-ω** or **-ομαι**. The easy part about forming these voices is that you already know the personal endings to apply to the verb stem: they are exactly identical to the **present tense -ω** endings from last semester.

| | Active | Middle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | -ω | -ομαι |
| 2nd sg. | -εις | -ῃ |
| 3rd sg. | -ει | -εται |
| 1st pl. | -ομεν | -όμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | -ετε | -εσθε |
| 3rd pl. | -ουσι(ν) | -ονται |

You simply need to add these endings to the **future tense stem**, which is the **2nd principal part minus the ending -ω or -ομαι**. So, let's take the verb κελεύω, "to order", as our paradigm example.

| | Active | Middle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | κελεύσω | κελεύσομαι |
| 2nd sg. | κελεύσεις | κελεύσῃ |
| 3rd sg. | κελεύσει | κελεύσεται |
| 1st pl. | κελεύσομεν | κελευσόμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | κελεύσετε | κελεύσεσθε |
| 3rd pl. | κελεύσουσι(ν) | κελεύσονται |

### Perfect Active Infinitive and Participle

Similary, the endings for the future active and middle infinitives and participles are exactly the same as those for **present tense -ω** verbs, but added to the **future stem** of the **2nd principal part**. So, if we keep using our paradigm verb κελεύω:

* future active infinitive: κελεύσειν
* future active participle: κελεύσων, κελεύσουσα, κελεῦσον (m./n. stem κελευσοντ-)
* future middle infinitive: κελεύσεσθαι
* future middle participle: κελευσόμενος, κελευσομένη, κελευσόμενον

## Perfect Middle/Passive

The **future passive** is built on the **6th principal part**, which you used last semester also to build the aorist passive. Because the future tense is a *primary* tense (i.e., not a past tense), we need to **un-augment** the stem of the 6th principal part in the same way that we would if we were forming an infinitive or participle from it. For a refresher on how to remove a syllabic or temporal augment from a verb, check out last semester's unit on [aorist infinitives](../infs-and-parts/infinitive-formation#aorist-infinitives).

So, our paradigm verb is κελεύω, which has a 6th principal part in ἐκελεύσθην. When we un-augment it, we are left with **κελευσθ-**. Then, to form the finite forms of the aorist passive, we can add the following endings (which all retain the -η- visible in the 6th principal part, add the characteristic -σ- future tense marker, and then use the future *middle* endings):

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | -ήσομαι | -ησόμεθα |
| 2nd | -ήσῃ | -ησέσθε |
| 3rd | -ήσεται | -ήσονται |

resulting in the following future passive forms for κελεύω:

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | κελευσθήσομαι | κελευσθησόμεθα |
| 2nd | κελευσθήσῃ | κελευσθησέσθε |
| 3rd | κελευσθήσεται | κελευσθήσονται |

### Perf. Mid./Pass. Infinitive and Participle

The future passive infinitive and participle are similarly formed from the un-augmented 6th principal part stem. The endings are a similar combination of tense and voice markers: the -η- of the principal part, the tense marker -σ-, and the same endings that you used for the future middle (-εσθαι for the infinitive or -όμενος, -ομένη, -όμενον for the participle):

* future passive infinitive: κελευσθήσεσθαι
* future passive participle: κελευσθησόμενος, κελευσθησομένη, κελυσθησόμενον

### Practice Opportunity 2

All the given forms are aorist passive. For all exercises, identify the **first principal part** of teh verb. Then, if the given verb form is *finite*, identify its **person and number**. If the given form is a *participle*, identify its **gender, case, and number**. If the given form is the *infinitive*, you don't need to do anything.
