## Perfect Tense Overview

Compared to the other tenses that you've learned so far (aorist, present, imperfect, and future), the **perfect tense** is more rare, but it will be beneficial to know how to identify it in context and how to translate it.

The **perfect** tense, as discussed [in the verb overview](overview#verb-aspects), indicates an action that occured in the past but has lasting effects into the present. This idea constitutes the third of the three verb **aspects**:

* present aspect: continuous, ongoing, incomplete action
* aorist(ic) aspect: instantaneous, completed action
* **perfect(ive) aspect**: action with effects that last beyond the action's completion

An illustration of perfect aspect is the following example: "He **has been seen**." The act of being seen occurred in the past, but he is still in the state of having been seen in the present tense; he can't be *un*seen.

Thus, the **perfect tense** is best expressed in English using **the auxiliary verb "has/have" with the past participle of the verb**, e.g. "has died", "have seen", "has spoken", "have wanted."

Like the other tenses that you already know, the perfect tense can be expressed in any of the three voices. For example:

* active: "They have ordered"
* middle: "They have ordered (for themselves)"
* passive: "They have been ordered"

The perfect tense will also complete our knowledge of the **principal parts**. The **fourth principal part** is used to conjugate the **perfect active** and also form its infinitive and participles. The **fifth principal part** is used to conjugate the **perfect middle and passive** and also form its infinitive and participles. Thus, the perfect operates similarly to the present tense: it has one form for **active** and one form for both **middle and passive**, so you will need to use context clues to figure out which voice your verb is.

### Reduplication and Perfect Tense Markers

Be aware that the tips and rules in this section are meant mainly to help you identify a perfect tense verb when you're looking at it. You will not be expected to memorize these rules or to generate a fourth or fifth principal part solely from looking at a first principal part, but being aware of reduplication and other perfect tense markers can help you identify a verb's meaning and form more easily.

The **perfect tense** in any voice will usually exhibit one tense marker: **reduplication**. Like an augment, **reduplication** affects the beginning of the verb stem, depending on the letter(s) that the verb stem begins with. However, unlike an augment, **reduplication cannot be removed or undone from a perfect tense stem**. This will be important when considering perfect infinitives, participles, and finite forms in the subjunctive or optative, especially since reduplication in some contexts can look like an augment.

There are four kinds of **reduplication**:

1) On most verbs that begin with a single consonant, reduplication involves **doubling the initial letter and adding -ε-**. Hence, notice the following transformations from a first principal part to a fourth and fifth:

* κελεύω > **κεκ**έλευκα, **κεκ**έλευσμαι
* δείκνυμι > **δέδ**ειχα, **δέδ**ειγμαι
* ποιέω > **πεπ**οίηκα, **πεπ**οίημαι

Note that if the single consonant is an aspirate (χ, φ, or θ), the reduplicated letter will be reduced to its non-aspirated form (χ -> κ, φ -> π, θ -> τ). For example, note from this unit's vocabulary:

* φεύγω -> **πέφ**ευγα

2) On verbs that begin with **the letters ζ, ρ, or a plosive + liquid or nasal combination** (see [consonant groups here](../basics/alphabet-and-accents#consonant-groups)), reduplication involves **adding an initial ε-**. Keep in mind, though, that this is ***not*** a syllabic augment that can be detached from a verb stem; it must remain when we are forming perfect infinitive, participle, subjunctive, optative, and imperative forms. For example:

* ζηλόω -> **ἐζ**ήλωκα, **ἐζ**ήλωμαι
* ῥίπτω -> **ἔρρ**ιφα, **ἔρρ**ιμμαι

3) On most verbs that begin with a **vowel**, reduplication involves **lengthening the vowel**, very similarly to a temporal augment on an indicative past tense verb. However, keep in mind that this lengthening ***must*** remain and not be undone when forming perfect infinitive, participle, subjunctive, optative, and imperative forms.

* ἀδικέω -> **ἠ**δίκηκα, **ἠ**δίκημαι
* αἱρέω -> **ᾕ**ρηκα, **ᾕ**ρημαι

4) Some verbs exhibit both a reduplication of an initial vowel + consonant *and* a lengthening of the vowel following the reduplicated syllable. These perfect forms may look completely irregular, but they often occur on commonly-seen verbs and must be memorized.

* ἀκούω -> ἀκήκοα
* ἔρχομαι -> ἐλήλυθα
* φέρω -> ἐνήνοχα, ἐνηνέγμαι

## Perfect Active

As mentioned above, the **perfect active** is built on the **4th principal part**. You get the stem to which you need to add the personal endings by removing the **-α**.

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | -α | -αμεν |
| 2nd | -ας | -ατε |
| 3rd | -ε(ν) | -ασι(ν) |

Note that these endings look very similar to the first aorist active endings except for the third plural (1st aor.: -αν; perfect: -ασι(ν)).

Let's use the fourth principal part of φέρω, ἐνήνοχα, to demonstrate the conjugation of the perfect active:

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | ἐνήνοχα | ἐνηνόχαμεν |
| 2nd | ἐνήνοχας | ἐνηνόχατε |
| 3rd | ἐνήνοχε(ν) | ἐνηνόχασι(ν) |

Person, number, and voice work exactly the same as they do in other tenses; the only change in translation here is the tense of the verb:

* ἐνήνοχα -> "I have carried"
* ἐνηνόχασι -> "They have carried"

### Perfect Active Infinitive and Participle

The formation of the perfect active infinitive and participle is a simple matter of adding endings to the fourth principal part stem. Recall that no matter what kind of reduplication the fourth principal part exhibits, you do ***not*** need to change anything about the stem (unlike when you needed to un-augment aorist principal parts to form aorist infinitives and participles).

The perfect active infinitive ending is **-έναι**, with a persistent accent on the -ε-.

The perfect active participle endings are **-ώς, -υῖα, -ός (m./n. stem -ότ-)**. Note the persistent accent on the vowel of the ending.

Let's stick with φέρω -> ἐνήνοχα as our paradigm here.

* perfect active infinitive: ἐνηνοχέναι

* perfect active participle: ἐνηνοχώς, ἐνηνοχυῖα, ἐνηνοχός (m./n. stem ἐνηνοχότ-)

## Perfect Middle/Passive

The **future passive** is built on the **6th principal part**, which you used last semester also to build the aorist passive. Because the future tense is a *primary* tense (i.e., not a past tense), we need to **un-augment** the stem of the 6th principal part in the same way that we would if we were forming an infinitive or participle from it. For a refresher on how to remove a syllabic or temporal augment from a verb, check out last semester's unit on [aorist infinitives](../infs-and-parts/infinitive-formation#aorist-infinitives).

So, our paradigm verb is κελεύω, which has a 6th principal part in ἐκελεύσθην. When we un-augment it, we are left with **κελευσθ-**. Then, to form the finite forms of the aorist passive, we can add the following endings (which all retain the -η- visible in the 6th principal part, add the characteristic -σ- future tense marker, and then use the future *middle* endings):

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | -ήσομαι | -ησόμεθα |
| 2nd | -ήσῃ | -ησέσθε |
| 3rd | -ήσεται | -ήσονται |

resulting in the following future passive forms for κελεύω:

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | κελευσθήσομαι | κελευσθησόμεθα |
| 2nd | κελευσθήσῃ | κελευσθησέσθε |
| 3rd | κελευσθήσεται | κελευσθήσονται |

### Perf. Mid./Pass. Infinitive and Participle

The future passive infinitive and participle are similarly formed from the un-augmented 6th principal part stem. The endings are a similar combination of tense and voice markers: the -η- of the principal part, the tense marker -σ-, and the same endings that you used for the future middle (-εσθαι for the infinitive or -όμενος, -ομένη, -όμενον for the participle):

* future passive infinitive: κελευσθήσεσθαι
* future passive participle: κελευσθησόμενος, κελευσθησομένη, κελυσθησόμενον

### Practice Opportunity 2

All the given forms are aorist passive. For all exercises, identify the **first principal part** of teh verb. Then, if the given verb form is *finite*, identify its **person and number**. If the given form is a *participle*, identify its **gender, case, and number**. If the given form is the *infinitive*, you don't need to do anything.
