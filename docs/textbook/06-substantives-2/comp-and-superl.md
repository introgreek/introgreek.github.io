## Adjective Degree

**Adjectives** have a **gender, case, and number**, each of which can be changed to match the noun that the adjective describes. We indicate the declension of an adjective by changing its ending depending on the declension group that it belongs to (e.g., 2-1-2 versus 3-1-3, 2-termination vowel declension versus 2-termination consonant declension).

This unit introduces a fourth aspect of adjectives: **degree**, which indicates the amount of the adjectival quality that the noun possesses, especially in comparison to other nouns that possess that quality. Look at the following English examples.

* That boy is **fast**.
* That boy is **faster** than the other boy.
* That boy is the **fastest** of all.

The boy in each of these sentences is fast, but the second and third sentences indicate that he has **more** speed than someone else or the **most** speed of anyone being compared to him.

These degrees are termed as follows:
* The **positive** degree of an adjective is the base level.
* The **comparative** degree of an adjective indicates that the noun being described has **more** of the adjectival quality than others. It is best translated as "**more** [adjective]" or, if the English adjective allows, "[adjective]**er**."
* The **superlative** degree of an adjective indicates that the noun being described has the **most** of the adjectival quality compared to anyone else who possesses it. It is best translated as "**most** [adjective]" or, if the English adjective allows, "[adjective]**est**."

The comparative and superlative degrees can also indicate individual amounts of an adjectival quality, rather than highlighting comparisons against others. This means that they can also be translated in the following ways:

* **comparative**: "too [adjective]", "rather [adjective]"
* **superlative**: "very [adjective]"
