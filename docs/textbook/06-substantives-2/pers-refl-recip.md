## Pronouns

Last semester, we learned about [pronouns](../nouns/pronouns), words that stand in for a noun called an **antecedent**. The pronoun has to *agree* in **gender and number** with the antecedent, but its case fits the use of the pronoun within its own clause. The different types of pronouns that we encountered last semester include **demonstratives**, which point things out (e.g., ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε or ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο) and the **relative pronoun** (ὅς, ἥ, ὅ, "who, which, that").

This unit introduces three new kinds of pronouns: **personal pronouns**, **reflexive pronouns**, and the **reciprocal pronoun**.

***

## Personal Pronouns

**Personal pronouns** are closely related to the idea of a **verb's person**; these are pronouns like "I", "you", or "they" that indicate a speaker's relationship to a sentence. Note that these pronouns are not limited to serving as the subjects of a verb, however; they can also be direct objects, possessors, indirect objects, etc.

* ***I*** saw the ships.
* The horse carried ***us*** into the road.
* ***We*** said true things to ***you***.

A personal pronoun, like any other pronoun, will have a **case, gender, and number**. In addition, however, another aspect that a personal pronoun will have is **person**. Person plus number yields the different kinds of personal pronouns, which are declined in the sections to follow.

One general item of note: **the nominative forms of these pronouns are used only for emphasis or to disambiguate between different subjects**. This makes intuitive sense, since the **verb** tells us who the subject is; a nominative subject is superfluous and unnecessary in that sense.

### First Person
{: .no_toc }

* I, me (singular); we, us (plural)

| | Regular | Non-Emphatic |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | ἐγώ | -- |
| Gen. Sg. | ἐμοῦ | μου |
| Dat. Sg. | ἐμοί | μοι |
| Acc. Sg. | ἐμέ | με |
| Nom. Pl. | ἡμεῖς | -- |
| Gen. Pl. | ἡμῶν | -- |
| Dat. Pl. | ἡμῖν | -- |
| Acc. Pl. | ἡμᾶς | -- |

Note that the non-emphatic forms of the pronoun are interchangeable with the regular forms of the pronoun, and they are all enclitics that tend to be post-positive:

* ὁ παῖς ἐμοὶ πολλὰ ἔλεγεν. The child was saying many things to me.

is exactly equivalent to

* ὁ παῖς μοι πολλὰ ἔλεγεν.

As the last example indicates, cases work as we expect them to: as direct objects, subjects of infinitives, possessors, etc.

* ὁ ἵππος πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἦλθεν. The horse came towards us.
* οἱ λόγοι μου ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ ἐγράφοντο. My words (lit. "The words of me") were being written in the book.
* ἡ μήτηρ ἐκέλευσεν ἐμὲ τὰ ὅπλα λαβεῖν. My mother ordered me to take the weapons.

### Second Person
{: .no_toc }

* you (singular); you, you all, y'all (plural)

| | Regular | Non-Emphatic |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | σύ | -- |
| Gen. Sg. | σοῦ | σου |
| Dat. Sg. | σοί | σοι |
| Acc. Sg. | σέ | σε |
| Nom. Pl. | ὑμεῖς | -- |
| Gen. Pl. | ὑμῶν | -- |
| Dat. Pl. | ὑμῖν | -- |
| Acc. Pl. | ὑμᾶς | -- |

Like the first person pronoun, the second person pronoun has unemphatic forms that are post-positive enclitics.

* πρέπει ὑμῖν ἀγαθὰ λέγειν. It is fitting for you all to say good things.
* ὁ πατὴρ σοῦ τὴν ὁδὸν ἐμοὶ ἔδειξεν. Your father (lit. "The father of you") showed the road to me.

### Third Person
{: .no_toc }

We have already encountered two pronouns that indicate third-person forms (he/him/his, she/her/hers, it/its, they/them/their):

* αὐτός, αὐτή, αὐτό
* the definite article ὁ, ἡ, τό

For a reminder on how to use these forms, you can refer back to last semester's unit on Pronouns for the sections on [αὐτός, αὐτή, αὐτό](../nouns/pronouns#αὐτός-αὐτή-αὐτό) and [the article](../nouns/pronouns#definite-articles).
