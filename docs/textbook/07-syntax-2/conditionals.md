## Conditions

**Conditions** or **conditionals** are **if/then statements**, wherein a condition is laid out for the performance of a verbal action. For example:

* If you ever say this, [then] you are right.
* If I study for the test, [then] I will get a good grade.
* If he were here, [then] he would see what is happening.

The condition is put forth by the "if" clause, and if the condition is met, then the action in the "then" clause gets performed. Note that the "then" in the main clause is most often understood, rather than explicitly stated in the sentence (hence the brackets in the examples above).

The **if clause** is called the **protasis**, and it is the **dependent clause**. In Greek, "if" is rendered with the conjunction **εἰ**. If negated, the protasis will use the negation **μή** (and the "if ... not" of the protasis can also be translated as "unless".)

The **then clause** (whether the "then" is explicitly stated or not) is called the **apodosis**, and it is the **main clause**. If negated, the apodosis will use the negation **οὐ**.

Conditions may also contain the generalizing particle **ἄν** in either the protasis or the apodosis, depending on the kind of condition being depicted. This **ἄν** may also combine with conjunctions that introduce the protasis. For example, **εἰ** + **ἄν** results in the conjunction **ἐάν**, which is used in some condition types.

The most simple type of condition simply uses indicative verbs in both the protasis and the apodosis, with no extra particles or complications. This is called a **simple condition**. For example:

* εἰ ἐμὲ ὁρᾷς, παρὰ σὲ ἵσταμαι. If you see me, I am standing near you.

However, there are several types of condition that will use various verb moods and tenses to indicate different things about whether the condition is a general truth, whether the condition will or might occur in the future, or whether the condition was actually met or not. Thus, outside of simple conditions (which are relatively rare), there are six major types of conditions, grouped into three categories, that we will discuss over the next few sections:

* general conditions that express timeless, indefinite, customary truths
  * **present general**
  * **past general**
* future conditions that indicate that a condition may or may not be met at a later point in time
  * **future more vivid**
  * **future less vivid**
* contrary-to-fact or contrafactual conditions that indicate that a condition is not currently being met or has not been met, and so the action of the apodosis isn't happening or didn't happen
  * **past contrary-to-fact**
  * **present contrary-to-fact**

Again, the criteria for determining which of the six conditions an if-then statement is rely mostly on the **tense and mood of both verbs in the condition**. We'll discuss each of these in turn.

### General Conditions

**General conditions** indicate timeless, indefinite, repeated, or customary truths in the past or present. They express conditions that don't refer to any specific instances; these are just the types of actions that generally would happen if a condition were met. As a result, the translation of the protasis of general conditions will often include the generalizing adverb "ever", even if there is no corresponding term for it in Greek.

A general condition can occur either now or in the past; thus, the two types of general condition are **present general** and **past general**:

* If you [ever] hear those words, you are lucky. (present general)
* If you [ever] heard those words, you were lucky. (past general)

The determination of which kind of condition is being used depends on the verb tense and mood in both the protasis and the apodosis *and* the presence of absence of ἄν:

| Condition Type | Protasis ("if") | Apodosis ("then") |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| present general | ἐάν + subjunctive ("[ever]") | present indicative |
| past general | εἰ + optative ("[ever]") | imperfect indicative |

Note that the protasis in both conditions uses the aspectual moods (subjunctive and optative) while the apodosis uses the indicative. The tenses also affect the choice: note how in a past general condition, the verb of the protasis is expected to be in the optative, since the main verb (imperfect indicative) is in secondary sequence. Another distinction is that the present general includes ἄν in the protasis (in the conjunction ἐάν), while the past general protasis does not.

Here's what the **present general** condition looks like in Greek:

* ἐὰν ἀκούῃς ἐκείνους τοὺς λόγους, εὐτυχὴς εἶ. If you [ever] hear those words, you are lucky.

And here's what the **past general** condition looks like in Greek:

* εἰ ἀκούοις ἐκείνους τοὺς λόγους, εὐτυχὴς ἦσθα. If you [ever] heard those words, you were lucky.

Note that in both types, the verbs, despite their moods, are translated as straightforward indicatives. This is necessary to ensure that we don't confuse general conditions with other types of conditions that may use auxiliary verbs like "would" or "should." General conditions simply express indefinite truths
