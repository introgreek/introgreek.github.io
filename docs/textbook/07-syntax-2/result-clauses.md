## Dependent Clauses Review

As we learned last semester, **dependent clauses** are sections of a sentence that is introduced by a subordinating word like a conjunction or a pronoun and contains its own finite verb, but they cannot stand on their own; they need the context of a **main clause** in order to make sense. We saw this, for example, in **relative clauses** and **indirect statements**:

* οἱ ἱππεῖς **οὓς εἴδομεν** εἰς τὰς ναῦς ἤρχοντο. The cavalrymen **whom we saw** were going into the ships.
* ὁ πολίτης ἀγγέλλει **ὅτι τὸν ἀγῶνα ἐνίκησας**. The citizen is announcing **that you won the contest**.

In both of these examples, the bolded **dependent clause** depends on the context of the **main clause** or a component of the main clause in order to make sense. The relative clause **οὓς εἴδομεν** hinges on the antecedent ἱππεῖς; the indirect statement relies on the head verb ἀγγέλλει.

## Result Clauses

This unit introduces a new kind of dependent clause: **result clauses**, which indicate the **outcome (result) of the action of the main verb**. Here is an example in English:

* It was *so* cold **that I put on a jacket**.

The coldness of the temperature *results* in the action of putting on a jacket.
