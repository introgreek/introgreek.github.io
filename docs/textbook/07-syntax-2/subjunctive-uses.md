## Independent versus Dependent Clauses

This unit explores the ways in which the **subjunctive** can be used in both **independent and dependent clauses**. A **clause** is a series of words that can communicate an idea, often centered around a **finite verb**. As we've seen, there are two major kinds of clauses: **independent clauses**, which stand on their own and communicate a complete thought; and **dependent clauses**, which are introduced by a subordinating conjunction or pronoun and require the context of a **main clause** in order to make sense. For example:

* independent: He stands near the house.
* dependent: Because he stands near the house... (we're left wondering what happens as a result of his standing near the house, which can be communicated by a main clause)

Recall that the **tenses of subjunctive verbs** indicate **aspect** rather than absolute time, so a present subjunctive and an aorist subjunctive can refer to the same moment in time; the difference is whether the action is continuous or ongoing (present aspect) or instantaneous or completed (aorist aspect).

Also, since the subjunctive deals in the realm of non-factual circumstances, the negation for these independent uses of the subjunctive will be **μή** and its associated forms (μηδέ, μήτε, and μηδείς), rather than οὐ and its associated forms, which are used for factual, indicative circumstances.

***

## Independent Uses

The following uses of the subjunctive are in independent clauses, meaning that these sentences stand on their own and do not need to be introduced by special conjunctions or pronouns.

### Hortatory Subjunctive

A **hortatory subjunctive** issues a **first-person** command. Most often, it will be a **first person plural** verb in the subjunctive that **exhorts** the group to do something. For example:

* **λάβωμεν** τὰ ὅπλα. **Let us take** the weapons.

The most straightforward translation for a hortatory subjunctive is **"let us [verb]"**, for which reason a funny alternative name for the hortatory subjunctive is the "salad" subjunctive ("let us" = "lettuce").

* τὰ βιβλία τοῖς διδασκάλοις μὴ **δῶμεν**. Let us not give the books to the teachers.
* * **ἴδωμεν** τὰς μεγάλας ναῦς. Let us see the big ships.

***

### Prohibitive Subjunctive

A **prohibitive subjunctive** issues a negative command in the **2nd or 3rd person**, using the negation **μή**: **"don't [verb]" or "let [subject] not [verb]."** For example:

* **μὴ ποιήσῃς** τὰ ἄδικα. Don't do the unjust things.
* ὁ παῖς **μὴ εἴπῃ** ἐκείνους τοὺς λόγους. Let the child not say those words.

Note as well that the negation includes associated forms as well:

* μηδεὶς τοῖς ἀδίκοις λέγῃ. Let no one speak to the unjust ones.

The difference between a prohibitive subjunctive and a negative hortatory subjunctive is the **person** of the verb: prohibitive subjunctives are 2nd or 3rd person, while hortatory subjunctives are first person.

***

### Deliberative Subjunctive

A **deliberative subjunctive** expresses a question wherein the speaker is *deliberating* in a course of action: "should...?". As a result, many deliberative subjunctives are in the first person.

* τῷδε πείθωμαι; Should I obey this person?
* τοῦ διδασκάλου ἀκούσωμεν; Should we listen to the teacher?

The clearest tell for a deliberative subjunctive is the presence of a question mark (;) at the end of the sentence.

* τοὺς ἵππους παρὰ τὴν οἰκίαν ἱστῶμεν; Should we make the horses stand near the house?
* τοὺς ἵππους παρὰ τὴν οἰκίαν ἱστῶμεν. Let us make the horses stand near the house.

***

## Dependent Uses

The following uses of the subjunctive are in **dependent clauses**, which means that they are clauses which need the context of a main verb in order to make sense. These dependent clauses that contain subjunctive verbs often function adverbially, to explain a circumstance or a reason behind the performance of the main verb, as we'll illustrate in a bit.

These dependent clauses will each be introduced by a **conjunction or pronoun** that will indicate that relationship between the dependent clause and the main clause.

Dependent clauses that contain the subjunctive are also governed by the [**sequence of moods**](subj-opt-overview#sequence-of-moods), wherein if the main verb is in a secondary tense, the subjunctive verb in the dependent clause can optionally be transformed into the optative, as we'll discuss more in depth once we learn about the formation of the optative in a later unit.

### Purpose Clauses

A **purpose clause** explains **the intention or purpose behind the action of the main verb**. Here's an English example:

* We are going into the city **so that we might/may see you all.**

The "so that" clause explains our purpose or intent in going to the city; we wanted to see you all. In this context, "we are going into the city" is the **main clause**, while "so that we might see you all" is the dependent **purpose clause**. "So that" is the conjunction that introduces the dependent clause, and the "might" or "may" in the verb comes from its subjunctive nature.

Note, however, that in English, a purpose clause can look deceptively like an *infinitive* if the **subject of the purpose clause** and the **subject of the main clause** are the **same**. For example, note that in the example sentence above, both "we are going" and "we might see" are first person plural. Thus, I can rewrite the sentence in the following ways:

* We are going into the city **in order to see you all.**
* We are going into the city **to see you all**.

Both of these sentences are functionally equivalent to their first iteration above, in which the purpose clause read "so that we might see you all." In English, they look like infinitives ("in order to see" or "to see"). **However, you cannot indicate a purpose clause using an infinitive in Greek as you can in English.**

In Greek, a **purpose clause** contains a subjunctive verb and can indicate either a positive intent or a negative intent, dependent on the conjunction and any associated negations that govern the clause:

* ἵνα, ὅπως, ὡς = positive purpose ("(so / in order) that; (in order) to")
* ἵνα μή, ὅπως μή, ὡς μή, μή = negative purpose ("(so / in order) that ... not; (in order) not to")

So, note the Greek translation(s) of the English example(s) above:

* We are going into the city **so that we might see you.**
    * ἐρχόμεθα εἰς τὴν πόλιν **ἵνα ὑμᾶς ἴδωμεν.**
    * ἐρχόμεθα εἰς τὴν πόλιν **ὅπως ὑμᾶς ἴδωμεν.**
    * ἐρχόμεθα εἰς τὴν πόλιν **ὡς ὑμᾶς ἴδωμεν.**

A negative purpose clause uses any of the positive conjunctions with the negation μή *or* simply μή as a conjunction itself:

* We are leaving the city **so that we might not see you** / **in order not to see you**.
    * λείπομεν τὴν πόλιν **ἵνα ὑμᾶς μὴ ἴδωμεν.**
    * λείπομεν τὴν πόλιν **ὅπως ὑμᾶς μὴ ἴδωμεν.**
    * λείπομεν τὴν πόλιν **ὡς ὑμᾶς μὴ ἴδωμεν.**
    * λείπομεν τὴν πόλιν **μὴ ὑμᾶς ἴδωμεν.**

Note that in the last example, **μή** serves as a full conjunction in its own right, rather than just a negation. Thus, the "so that ... not" or "in order not to" is taken care of entirely by μή, and we don't need any extra negations or conjunctions to fill out the negative purpose clause.

#### ὡς

It's worth noting that one of the conjunction options, ὡς, has been used in three other contexts before: [indirect statements](subordination/indirect-statement#ὅτι--ὡς), [result clauses](result-clauses), and [superlative adjectives/adverbs](../substantives-2/comp-and-superl#superlative-with-ὡς--ὅτι). The key to telling ὡς clauses apart is in the context of what precedes and follows the ὡς.

For example:
* if the main verb is a head verb (to say, to speak, to think, to know, etc.) and the ὡς clause contains an indicative verb, it's probably an indirect statement.
* If there is a οὕτως in the main clause and the ὡς clause contains an indicative verb, it's probably an actual result clause.
* If a superlative adjective or adverb immediately follows the ὡς, it's a superlative use.
* If the ὡς has a subjunctive verb after it, then it's probably a purpose clasue.

* ὁ παῖς ἀγγέλλει **ὡς** ὑμᾶς εἴδομεν. The child announces that we saw you all. (indirect statement)
* ἀπὸ τῆς νέως οὕτως ἤλθετε **ὡς** ὑμᾶς εἴδομεν. You all came from the ship in such a way that we saw you all. (result clause)
* **ὡς** τάχιστα ἤλθετε. You all came as quickly as possible. (superlative)
* ἐρχόμεθα εἰς τὴν πόλιν **ὡς** ὑμᾶς ἴδωμεν. We are going into the city in order to see you all. (purpose clause)

#### Future Participle Indicating Purpose

We can also express purpose in Greek by using a **future participle** rather than a full subjunctive dependent clause. The participle will agree in gender, case, and number with the noun that has that purpose or intention in mind; often it will be the subject of the main verb.

* ἡμεῖς εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἐρχόμεθα **ὑμᾶς ὀψόμενοι**. We are going into the city **in order to see you all**.

The future middle participle ὀψόμενοι agrees with the subject ἡμεῖς in gender, case, and number (masculine nominative plural), indicating that it is *we* who intended to see you all.

***

### Fear Clauses

A **fear clause** explains the substance of a fear expressed in the main clause, i.e., what the person being afraid is actually afraid of, if they are afraid of something that **will/might happen** or that **could be presently happening but we're not entirely sure**. For example:

* I am afraid **that he will/might send the horses away**.

The "that" clause expresses a positive fear: I am afraid that the action of him sending the horses away will happen. For a **positive fear clause** like this, the conjunction that introduces the clause will, counterintuitively, be **μή**:

* φοβοῦμαι **μὴ τοὺς ἵππους ἀφῇ.** (ἀφῇ > 3rd sg. aor. act. subj. from ἀφίημι)

Do not be fooled by the presence of the **μή**: it is not a negation in this sentence, but rather, it's a conjunction that introduces a fear clause and is simply translated as "that."

A **negative fear clause** expresses a fear that something will *not* happen and uses the conjunction **μή οὐ**.

* φοβοῦμαι **μὴ ἐμὲ οὐ φιλῇς**. I am afraid **that you don't love me**.

Note that if the fear is more definite (e.g., the feared action happened in the past or it's definitely happening in the present), a fear clause can use an indicative verb.

* φοβοῦμαι **μὴ ἐμὲ οὐκ εἶδες.** I am afraid **that you didn't see me**.
